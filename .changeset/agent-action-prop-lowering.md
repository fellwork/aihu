Fix agent-driven `$action`/`$prop` lowering on the capability-bridge (client) path:

- `batch(fn)` now returns its callback's value (was typed and implemented as `void`). The compiler lowers a `$action` handler to `return batch(() => { … })`, so an agent driving the action now receives the handler's return value instead of `undefined`. Callers that batch purely for side effects are unaffected.
- The compiler emits writable-`$prop` write invokers as `(v) => name.set(v)` (the prop signal's setter) instead of `(v) => { name = v }`, which reassigned the `const` prop binding — a `TypeError` that also never reached the signal. Applied across the server `__agentBinding`, the client `__agentDispatcher` export, and the in-setup `_registerAgentDispatcher`.

Net: over the capability bridge an agent can now read computed/prop state, drive actions and receive their return values, and write props — no `serialize()`-snapshot workaround. (A separate, deeper gap — `@state` macros not lowered at all in the server/universal build, breaking headless `__agentBinding` dispatch — is tracked in TODOS.md.)
