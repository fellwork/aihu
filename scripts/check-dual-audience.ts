/**
 * check:dual-audience — thesis §1: humans and agents are both first-class
 * audiences of ONE codebase, and the agent axis is a real projection rather
 * than the UI re-serialized.
 *
 * "Any content reachable only by executing the site's presentation logic is
 * unavailable to the agent axis entirely."
 *
 * The furthest property: the scorecard measures 0/4. Four sub-checks, each
 * one finding:
 *
 *   DA-a  A markdown representation can be PRODUCED. `MarkdownResolver` must
 *         have a real implementation — a VALUE, exported from a package public
 *         entry. Today every reference is the interface declaration, the config
 *         field, a `dist/*.d.ts` re-export, or a test mock.
 *
 *   DA-b  Negotiation reaches non-`Accept` clients. Behavioral: build the real
 *         middleware, send a request with NO `Accept` header and a crawler
 *         user-agent, expect markdown. Today `content-negotiation.ts` reads
 *         `Accept` and nothing else, and AI crawlers do not send it.
 *
 *   DA-c  Primary content is retrievable without JS. Behavioral: drive the real
 *         `createServerRouter(...).handle(req)` and look for the content and the
 *         hydration markers in the raw body. Today `router/src/server.ts:41`
 *         calls `renderToString(component)` with NO options, and every marker in
 *         `ssr.ts` is gated on `opts?.hydratable ?? false`.
 *
 *   DA-d  The SAME assertion against the PRERENDER (SSG) path. Behavioral:
 *         drive the real `runPrerender(...)` over a temp fixture and read the
 *         HTML it actually writes to disk. `packages/app/src/prerender.ts:283`
 *         and `:382` call `renderToString(...)` with NO options — the identical
 *         defect class as `router/src/server.ts:41`, in a second reachable
 *         production path.
 *
 * ⚠️ DA-d is a SCOPE DECISION, not a newly introduced defect. The prerender
 * path was always broken this way; the check simply did not look at it. The
 * founder ruled prerender in scope on 2026-07-19, so this check went from
 * measuring 3 to measuring 4. NOTHING IS FIXED by adding it — the baseline
 * moves 3 → 4 because the check now SEES a defect that was already shipping,
 * and `check:dual-audience` must still fail. `baselines.json` carries that
 * reason; the scorecard row moves 0/3 → 0/4 for the same reason.
 *
 * ─── GX Phase 5 (#467) — the governed dual-audience seams (40-spec §10) ─────
 *
 * Three additional sub-checks make the Phase-4 governed boundary's
 * dual-audience guarantees non-regressable. Shared fixture:
 * `scripts/lib/governed-fixture.ts` (also driven by `check:governed` G4/G5),
 * standing up the REAL `createServerRouter` + registry over the REAL compiled
 * census row of `bench/compiler-conformance/route/04-governed-data.aihu`.
 *
 *   DA-f1  PER-VALUE SENTINEL BYTE CHECKS (E6 generalized into a standing
 *          check): for a WITHHELD principal (anonymous AND lapsed-entitlement)
 *          each governed value's sentinel is absent from the ENTIRE response —
 *          HTML and the `__aihu_loader__` JSON channel scanned per sentinel;
 *          the declared preview still renders. For an ENTITLED principal the
 *          granted values are present AS GRANTED (headword in server HTML —
 *          reachable without JS; the full payload on the loader channel).
 *          Regression proven: a withheld response whose loader embed carries
 *          the granted payload (the redact-at-serialize-instead-of-
 *          never-fetch regression, §4.5's forbidden shape) is flagged.
 *
 *   DA-f2  THREE-ARTIFACT AGREEMENT over the committed conformance corpus:
 *          the `// @aihu:extract` code marker and the `.route.json` sidecar
 *          must carry the SAME policy for every route fixture, and a `data:`
 *          declaration in the source must ride the census (present, well-formed
 *          under the runtime's own `normalizeGovernedData`, type + preview
 *          tokens agreeing with the source). The committed artifacts are
 *          byte-pinned to the compiler by the Rust golden suite; the agent-meta
 *          leg (manifest ≡ marker ≡ route.json) lives in
 *          `extract_vocabulary.rs`'s `fan_out_three_artifacts_agree_*` tests —
 *          this check asserts those pins still EXIST, so no leg of the fan-out
 *          can be silently deleted. HONEST SCOPE: `data:` fans out to
 *          `.route.json` (+ the type sidecar) only — the marker and agent-meta
 *          do not carry it, so `data:` agreement is source ≡ census, not
 *          three-way.
 *
 *   DA-f3  DISCOVERY AGREEMENT: the generated discovery artifacts —
 *          robots.txt, llms.txt, and the served `X-Robots-Tag` header — must
 *          agree with each surface's declared `read:` across the full value
 *          vocabulary (all/agents/search/none/verified/human/{scope}/malformed,
 *          plus the compiled census route): hard values are ABSENT from every
 *          anonymous artifact (existence never advertised), `'none'` gets its
 *          honest Disallow + noindex, public values stay listed. Regression
 *          proven: hand-leaked documents (a Disallow line naming the governed
 *          path; an llms.txt row listing it) are flagged. HONEST SCOPE:
 *          per-principal discovery (an authenticated agent's OWN listing of
 *          entitled surfaces) has no shipped surface on main yet — that leg
 *          activates when one lands; nothing here should be read as covering it.
 *
 * DA-c and DA-d are separate findings because they are separate defects in
 * separate files with separate fixes: DA3 repairing the router does not repair
 * the SSG writer. Grouping them would let one fix silently decrement a baseline
 * that covered two live defects.
 *
 * DA-a's exclusions are the load-bearing part of this check. The four
 * `tests/compliance/` suites report green precisely because THE TEST SUPPLIES
 * THE THING THAT DOES NOT EXIST — `isitagentready.test.ts` injects its own mock
 * `mdResolver`. So DA-a refuses to count test mocks, refuses `dist/`, refuses a
 * TYPE (a re-exported interface is not an implementation), and refuses a
 * resolver constructed inside this check.
 *
 * DA-c asserts the PRESENCE OF MARKERS and the REACHABILITY OF TEXT, never an
 * exact markup string — the explicit anti-`hydrate.test.ts` guard, that suite
 * having hand-written the `hydrate.0` markup it then asserted.
 *
 * NO suppression comments are supported.
 *
 * Wired into CI (plan-a.yml `check` job). Run via the npm script, NOT bare bun:
 *   bun run check:dual-audience
 *
 * `SCRIBE_NATIVE_SKIP=1` selects the TypeScript SSR fallback ("slower, always
 * correct"), matching what `vitest.config.ts` sets for the same reason; the
 * native renderer binary is not built in a plain checkout.
 *
 * ⚠️ This script previously also passed `--tsconfig-override ./tsconfig.json`,
 * to force the ROOT `paths` map onto every file because the per-package
 * tsconfigs declared `paths` with no `baseUrl` and bun therefore ignored them.
 * That override was REMOVED: it forced an INCOMPLETE map onto package sources
 * and broke resolution it was meant to fix — the root map has no
 * `@aihu/router/plugin` entry, so `packages/app/src/prerender.ts` (which DA-d
 * drives) failed to resolve under it. The per-package tsconfigs now carry
 * `baseUrl`, so their own already-correct maps apply. Removing it also silences
 * the `Internal error: directory mismatch` Bun emits for that flag.

// The DA4 flip LANDED: the founder-ratified classifier
// (`docs/architecture/thesis.md` §DA4) makes `@route`-block components pages,
// and pages now DEFAULT to `shadowMode: 'none'` (light DOM) — the compiler
// emits a `// @aihu:shadow-default none` marker for an unpinned page, and
// W472 (the phase-1 advisory) is retired. An unpinned page is therefore no
// longer future-behavior-changing; this scan remains an informational census
// of pages riding the implicit default (vs pinning it explicitly). Promoting
// it to an enforced finding class (ratification amendment 4 contemplated
// this) is a follow-up decision, not automatic at the flip.
//
// The detector mirrors the compiler's page classifier (emit.rs): `@route`
// block present AND no `$shadow` macro. Text-shape match rather than a
// compiler invocation, deliberately — this check must run on a plain checkout
// with no Rust binary built, and an informational count does not warrant
// spawning the compiler per file.
