/**
 * Fixture: the exact shape of `packages/agent-server/src/opaque-id.ts:4`.
 *
 * This says "Mirrors the compiler's `opaque_member_id`" and MUST NOT be a
 * finding. It is a cross-language (TS↔Rust) algorithm parity note: there is no
 * second TypeScript declaration for D1 to pair it with, and no artifact array
 * for D2 to match. A naive comment-grep flags it and blows check:derived's
 * count from 2 to 3.
 *
 * This is the sharpest guard in the check. Open question #3 in the spec asks
 * whether this SHOULD count; it is specified as must-not-flag, and changing
 * that is above this slice's authority.
 *
 * Mirrors the compiler's `opaque_member_id` in
 * `packages/compiler/src/codegen/emit.rs` — this MUST stay byte-identical to
 * the Rust emit, and is kept in sync with it by golden vectors.
