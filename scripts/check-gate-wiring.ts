/**
 * check-gate-wiring.ts — C-FEL-428 gate-wiring meta-check.
 *
 * Two properties per gate: (1) REACHABILITY — some CI path invokes it; (2)
 * NEGATIVE FIXTURE — its red path was EXECUTED this run and observed to exit
 * non-zero. Both halves below.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: a gate that no CI path ever invokes is green-by-construction
 * — it can never make a PR red, so it protects nothing. That is the
 * FEL-438/FEL-430 shape ("an invariant parked outside CI protects nothing",
 * check:emit-parses' own plan-a.yml comment). This meta-check enumerates every
 * gate and asserts each is REACHABLE by CI.
 *
 * REACHABILITY = EITHER ROUTE (orchestrator amendment, post-#673): a gate is
 * reachable if it is in the `check:ci` transitive chain OR an actual `run:`
 * step in any .github/workflows/*.yml invokes it. The repo DELIBERATELY runs
 * cheap always-on gates as their own workflow job (lesson-refs, readme-sync)
 * rather than inside check:ci; a check:ci-ONLY test would flag those
 * correctly-wired gates and pressure someone to undo #673.
 *
 * ...BUT THE CHAIN ROUTE IS CONDITIONAL, and this is the correction that this
 * meta-check most needed (C-FEL-GATE-WIRING-RUNS). Membership in `check:ci`
 * only means "CI invokes this gate" IF SOME WORKFLOW INVOKES `check:ci`. On
 * main it did not — plan-a.yml says so in its own words ("`check:ci` is invoked
 * by no workflow in this repo") — so the chain route was asserting a fact that
 * was false, and it was covering for exactly ONE gate: check:gate-wiring
 * ITSELF, which appeared in no `run:` step anywhere in .github/. The meta-check
 * that exists to forbid green-by-construction gates was one. So the chain route
 * is now GATED on `ciChainIsWired` below, derived from the same `run:` bodies as
 * everything else. Self-correcting in both directions: wire `check:ci` into a
 * workflow and the chain route becomes valid again automatically; unwire it and
 * every chain-only gate is reported. Nothing here hardcodes today's answer.
 *
 * DANGLING CHAIN REFERENCE (same contract): `bun run check:grammar-v` sat in the
 * check:ci chain naming a script that does not exist — the script is
 * check:grammar-v2. `bun run` on an undefined name exits 1, so local check:ci
 * died mid-chain, and check:grammar-v2 fell out of the chain and became a NEW
 * ORPHAN. Both facts were true on main and neither was visible, because of the
 * paragraph above. A name that resolves to no script is now RED in its own
 * right: it is a gate invocation that cannot invoke a gate.
 *
 * A workflow "invokes" a gate if a run: body names it by `check:<name>` OR by
 * the SCRIPT PATH its command runs. storybook.yml runs check:stories by PATH
 * (`bun scripts/check-required-stories.ts`), not by name — matching only the
 * name would mis-flag a correctly-wired gate as an orphan.
 *
 * TWO PARSE TRAPS, both of which flip a TRUE finding into a FALSE one (the
 * self-test below reproduces each before trusting the scan):
 *   1. COMMENTS ARE NOT INVOCATIONS. plan-a.yml MENTIONS check:agent-conformance
 *      in a YAML comment ("NOT here — see the lesson-refs job"). That is not a
 *      run step. We read ONLY `run:` step bodies, and strip shell `#` comments.
 *   2. `on.push.paths` FILTERS LIST SCRIPT PATHS (e.g. scripts/check-required-
 *      stories.ts) but do not RUN them. Same fix: only `run:` bodies count.
 *
 * DEBT, NOT A HARD FAIL (slice-0 idiom, docs/plans/slice-0-invariants): two
 * gates are orphaned on main today (check:hmr, check:hydration-adoption) and
 * this contract's SURFACE forbids rewiring them. So the orphan set is locked
 * against a committed baseline: exit 0 iff current === baseline. A NEW orphan
 * is red and named; a baseline orphan that gets WIRED is ALSO red (forces the
 * baseline decrement into the same PR as the fix). The baseline is printed as
 * DEBT every run so it cannot go quiet.
 *
 * SURFACE (C-FEL-428): this meta-check + its baseline only. It does NOT rewrite
 * or rewire any individual gate to fix what it finds.
 *
 * NEGATIVE FIXTURE (ruling 1): a gate is PROVEN only if its red command is
 * EXECUTED in this run and observed to exit non-zero — declared/registered is
 * not enough (that would be green-by-construction, the meta-gate becoming an
 * instance of its own subject). Gates not yet proven are grandfathered into a
 * SHRINK-ONLY ramp (scripts/gate-fixture-baseline.json) so this does not require
 * rewriting ~20 gates on day one; the ramp can only shrink as gates opt in. See
 * NEGATIVE_FIXTURES below.

// against wiring any gate as its own job at all. This closes it structurally, so
// own-job is safe rather than merely careful — and the check is the same parse
// of plan-a.yml the reachability half already does.

 *
 * THIS LIST IS NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT, AND THE TWO-KEY SHAPE IS THE POINT.
 * A name here silences nothing on its own — the check below ALSO requires that
 * ci-ok genuinely reads `needs.<job>.outputs.*`. So an exemption takes a human
 * DECLARING it and the machine VERIFYING the property holds.
 *
 * I briefly replaced this with a pure derivation ("no list; exempt iff outputs
 * are consumed"), reasoning that any allowlist is the fail-open shape this
 * contract fixed in ci-ok's own loop. That was WRONG, and measurably so: with
 * the pure form, adding a job to `needs:` plus a single unused
 * `FOO: ${{ needs.badjob.outputs.x }}` line silently exempts it — one key, no
 * declaration, EXIT 0. The two-key form flags it, because the name is absent
 * here. Pure derivation lets an exemption APPEAR; this makes it a deliberate act.
 *
 * The hazard I thought I was closing does not exist against the two-key form:
 * "just append the name" cannot silence a real gate, since the outputs proof
 * still fails. A NEW legitimate outputs-provider that nobody lists is FLAGGED —
 * friction that fails CLOSED, which is the correct direction for an exemption.
 *
 * OR, not XOR: a job may legitimately be BOTH gated AND export a value ci-ok
 * reads. The exemption branch below is only reached when the job is ABSENT from
 * the loop, so that arrangement never consults this list and cannot false-red.
 * (XOR would flag it, and a false red is pressure to widen the exemption.)
