/**
 * CI guard — `@aihu/use` registry parity (src <-> registry, bidirectional),
 * NOW FAMILY-AWARE (namespace-wave0: CORE stays dependency-free; FAMILY
 * subpaths — `math`, `motion`, `router`, `integrations` — may declare
 * optional peers, `packages/use/families.json` is the single source of
 * truth for which families exist).
 *
 * A CORE composable directory `packages/use/src/<name>/index.ts` and a
 * FAMILY member directory `packages/use/src/<family>/<name>/index.ts` must
 * all agree, in BOTH directions, across SIX companion registrations:
 *   1. barrel export in packages/use/src/index.ts (CORE names only — a
 *      family name found here is a FAIL, not a pass: the core barrel is
 *      family-free by the one-way import rule)
 *   2. `./<name>` (or `./<family>/<name>`) key in packages/use/package.json
 *      `exports`
 *   3. `<name>: 'src/<name>/index.ts'` (or the quoted `'<family>/<name>'`
 *      form) in packages/use/rolldown.config.ts `input`
 *   4. a `@aihu/use/<name>` (or `@aihu/use/<family>/<name>`) row in root
 *      .size-limit.json
 *   5. a `("<name>", "@aihu/use/<family>/<name>")` tuple in
 *      packages/compiler/src/codegen/use_registry.rs USE_COMPOSABLES —
 *      REQUIRED only when the owning family (or, for CORE, always) has
 *      `autoImport: true`; a member of an `autoImport: false` family MUST
 *      NOT have a tuple (injecting an auto-import for an optional-peer
 *      composable is a hard bundler resolution break in apps that lack the
 *      peer — verified against vite 8.0.16) — EXCEPT names in
 *      REGISTRY_EXEMPT (opt-out allowlist for CORE one-offs, one-line
 *      justification required per entry).
 *   6. a hand-written Tier-2 row in packages/use/tests/ssr-safety.test.ts —
 *      REQUIRED iff the composable's source references `isClient`
 *      (otherwise optional; nothing to assert either way).
 *
 * Plus family-level (not per-composable) invariants:
 *   - a family with `aggregate: true` and >=1 discovered member must carry
 *     an aggregate barrel (`src/<family>/index.ts`), a bare `./<family>`
 *     exports key, a bare `<family>` rolldown input, and a
 *     `@aihu/use/<family>` size row.
 *   - a family with `aggregate: false` (or zero discovered members) must
 *     carry NONE of the four above — this is what keeps a bare
 *     `@aihu/use/integrations` from silently reappearing (aggregate entries
 *     are a hard `vite build` resolution break for any family whose members
 *     carry different optional peers — verified).
 *   - every family directory found on disk must be declared in
 *     `families.json` (no orphan family dirs). The converse — "every
 *     declared family has >=1 member" — is DELIBERATELY NOT enforced: this
 *     namespace's four families are pre-declared, founder-ratified
 *     architecture ahead of their first composable landing, and a hard
 *     "must have a member" gate would block landing that declaration at all.
 *
 * "Bidirectional" means: a composable dir missing ANY of its required
 * manifest entries is an error, AND a manifest entry with no backing src/
 * directory (a ghost row — e.g. a leftover after a rename, or a copy/paste
 * typo) is ALSO an error. Every name is checked against every source it is
 * expected to appear in.
 *
 * `shared` is the one documented non-composable subpath and is excluded from
 * all source discovery. Family AGGREGATE names (`math`, `motion`, `router`)
 * are tracked separately from composable/member names — they are not
 * "composables" for the six-touch-point rule, they get their own four-part
 * check above.
 *
 * Run: bun run check:use-registry-parity
 *
 * Wired into `check:ci` (right after `check:size-rows`, same family of
 * manifest cross-checks) and as its own early step in
 * `.github/workflows/plan-a.yml` (right after `check:compiler-binary-bump`
 * — both are cheap, no-build-required guards over the same
 * Rust-source-adjacent surface).
