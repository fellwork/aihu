/**
 * scripts/lib/native-binary-bump.ts
 *
 * Shared core for the "native binary bump" CI guards: a change to a package's
 * Rust source MUST bump the platform binary packages, or the fix never ships.
 *
 * Extracted from scripts/check-compiler-binary-bump.ts (FEL-414) so the same
 * proven rule set — lockstep bumps across every platform of every affected
 * family, plus the host manifest's optionalDependencies pins repointed —
 * applies to every native-binary package in the monorepo, not just the
 * compiler. See scripts/check-compiler-binary-bump.ts for the FEL-414 history
 * this was originally hardened against (a partial bump of ONE family passing
 * the old, looser check, stranding @aihu/compiler-native-* on npm at 0.1.0
 * through nine CLI bumps).
 *
 * A package with native binaries defines a `BumpCheckerConfig` (its platform
 * families, host manifest path, and source-file predicates) and gets a fully
 * tested checker via `createBumpChecker(config)`. One family (e.g.
 * @aihu/css-engine, @aihu/server) is just the one-family case of the same
 * general rule.
