/**
 * CI guard: every platform pin must be RESOLVED in `bun.lock`.
 *
 * Step 1 of docs/plans/2026-08-10-platforms-before-pins.md, landed first and
 * on purpose: it is the failing test the ordering fix has to turn green.
 *
 * ── THE STATE THIS CATCHES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Bun cannot resolve an `optionalDependency` that is not published, so it
 * silently OMITS it from the lockfile rather than failing. Under lockstep a
 * release writes pins naming a version that does not exist yet, so this is
 * exactly what happens on every Version PR:
 *
 *   pins say 1.3.1  ->  1.3.1 unpublished  ->  bun drops all ten entries
 *                                              -> lock and manifests disagree
 *
 * The disagreement is invisible until the versions publish, at which point
 * every `bun install --frozen-lockfile` wants to add them back and is refused.
 * That took `main` red for every PR twice — #783 (v0.4.62) and #794 (v0.4.64) —
 * and both times the only symptom was a confusing frozen-lockfile error in an
 * unrelated job.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS GREEN TODAY, AND WHY THAT IS CORRECT ───────────────────────────
 *
 * Right now all 18 pins resolve, because v0.4.64 published them and #794
 * refreshed the lock. A guard that only fires in a transient state is still
 * worth having: this is precisely the guard that would have caught the window
 * between #791 and #794 at the PR that opened it, instead of at a stranger's
 * unrelated CI run hours later.
 *
 * It goes red the moment a Version PR bumps the pins ahead of the registry —
 * which is the current, unfixed behaviour. When the platforms-before-pins
 * change lands, it stays green through the Version PR too, and THAT is the
 * signal the fix worked.
 *
 * ── SCOPE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Checks all three hosts, not just the lockstepped one. css-engine and server
 * still hand-bump, and a hand-bumped pin can be typo'd or point at something
 * unpublished just as easily.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun scripts/check-lockfile-platform-pins.ts
 *   LOCKFILE_PINS_ROOT=/tmp/fixture bun scripts/check-lockfile-platform-pins.ts
