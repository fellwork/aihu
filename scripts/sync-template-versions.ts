/**
 * `sync-template-versions` — generate the dependency ranges the CLI scaffolds.
 *
 * ## The bug class this closes
 *
 * Every `@aihu/*` entry a scaffold emitted was the literal string `"latest"`.
 * That is not a version, it is a *promise to resolve later*, and it has three
 * properties nobody wants from a scaffolding tool:
 *
 *   1. NOT REPRODUCIBLE. A project scaffolded today and one scaffolded in six
 *      months share a `package.json` byte-for-byte and install two different
 *      dependency graphs. Neither manifest records which one it was.
 *   2. NOT AUDITABLE. `"latest"` is compatible with every future major. A
 *      breaking `@aihu/runtime` publish reaches every existing scaffold on its
 *      owner's next `install` — not on an upgrade they chose.
 *   3. NOT REVIEWABLE. There was no mechanism to sync a template's declared
 *      versions to anything, so nothing could be wrong and nothing could be
 *      checked. `check-pins-published.ts` guards platform *binaries* only.
 *
 * ## What this emits, and from what
 *
 * Every non-private workspace package under `packages/` whose name starts with
 * `@aihu/` or `@aihu-plugin/` contributes ONE caret range derived from its own
 * `package.json` `version`. Nothing is hand-typed and there is no curated list
 * to drift: add a package, it appears; bump a package, its range moves.
 *
 * A caret range, not an exact pin, deliberately. A scaffold is a STARTING
 * POINT: `^6.0.0` lets a user pick up `6.0.1` without editing a manifest, while
 * still refusing `7.0.0`. An exact pin would freeze a new project on the
 * release it was born from, which is the opposite failure.
 *
 * ## Why the version can lead the registry, and why that is correct
 *
 * Run on this repo today, `@aihu/compiler` is `1.2.2` in-tree and `1.2.0` on
 * npm, so the emitted `^1.2.2` is momentarily unsatisfiable. That is not a
 * defect of this script — it is the release pipeline's normal state, the same
 * one `check-pins-published.ts` documents for platform binaries. The templates
 * that carry these ranges ship INSIDE `@aihu/cli` / `@aihu/templates-*`, which
 * are published by the very release that publishes the versions named here
 * (`release.yml` orders the publishes). A user only ever runs a *published*
 * `create-aihu`, and its ranges name versions that release put on npm.
 *
 * Which is why this runs in `release:version` (see package.json), right after
 * `changeset version` sets the versions that are about to be published.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 *   bun scripts/sync-template-versions.ts           # regenerate
 *   bun scripts/sync-template-versions.ts --check   # CI: fail if stale
 *
 * ## Fixture overrides (check-gate-wiring's negative fixture)
 *
 * `TEMPLATE_VERSIONS_PACKAGES_DIR` repoints the version SOURCE at a fixture
 * tree and `TEMPLATE_VERSIONS_TS_TARGET` repoints the generated-module TARGET.
 * Setting the target override also SKIPS the cf-team targets — they read the
 * real workspace and would mismatch a fixture source unconditionally, which
 * would make the fixture red for the wrong reason (a gate that says "no" to
 * everything proves nothing). Never set either by hand.

 * THIRD-PARTY ranges a scaffold pins, kept here rather than typed into each

 * `apps/web/package.json.tmpl`, and the legacy golden), and a range that lives
 * in four places is a range nobody can change.
 *
 * `vite`: `^6 || ^8`, not `^6.0.0`.
 *
 * Vite 8 was genuinely unsafe until commit e817455a: vite 8 made esbuild an
 * OPTIONAL PEER while still exporting `transformWithEsbuild`, the compiler's
 * strip chain tested only that the FUNCTION existed, and a fresh `^8` install
 * (which has no esbuild at all) therefore threw inside the strip and — via a
 * swallowing catch — returned UN-STRIPPED TypeScript to rolldown. That commit
 * ungated `transformWithOxc` and made a failed strip fatal, which removes the
 * coupling rather than pinning around it. Vite 6 cannot regress: it does not
 * export `transformWithOxc` at all, so it keeps taking the esbuild branch.
 *
 * Vite 7 is EXCLUDED, and the omission is deliberate rather than an oversight:
 * no cell of the scaffold matrix has ever installed it, so listing it would be
 * a compatibility claim with no measurement behind it. `^6 || ^8` names exactly
 * the two majors `scaffold-consistency` builds on every PR.
