# publish-all.sh — publish all @aihu/* packages to npm in dependency order.
# Run from the aihu workspace root.
#
# Strategy: `bun pm pack` rewrites `workspace:*` deps to real version ranges
# at pack time, then `npm publish <tarball>` uploads using npm's auth. This
# split sidesteps `bun publish` failing to read the ${NODE_AUTH_TOKEN}
# placeholder that actions/setup-node writes into ~/.npmrc — npm resolves
# that placeholder; bun does not.
#
# Prereqs:
#   1. npm login  (or NODE_AUTH_TOKEN env in CI via setup-node)
#   2. bun install
#   3. moon run :build  (or scripts/build-data-compiler.sh for missing pkgs)
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/publish-all.sh                        # live publish to `latest`
#   ./scripts/publish-all.sh --dry-run              # dry-run (no network write)
#   ./scripts/publish-all.sh --tag canary           # live publish to `canary` dist-tag
#   ./scripts/publish-all.sh --dry-run --tag canary # canary dry-run (pack + validate only)
