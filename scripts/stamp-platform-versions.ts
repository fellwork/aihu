/**
 * stamp-platform-versions.ts — make every native platform package carry its
 * host's version, and every host pin point at exactly that.
 *
 * Was `stamp-platform-snapshot.ts`, which did this for canary snapshots only.
 * The mechanism is identical for a stable release; only the guard differed. See
 * `--require-snapshot` below for the one behaviour that is canary-specific and
 * must stay that way.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The platform packages under `packages/<host>/{npm,npm-native}/<platform>/`
 * are NOT workspace members — the root `workspaces` glob is `packages/*`, which
 * does not match nested dirs — so changesets never versions them. Historically
 * they were bumped BY HAND: 23 files for a single compiler change (5 CLI
 * manifests + 5 napi manifests + 10 `optionalDependencies` pins + a
 * sync-readme regen). That toil was real, and it was mostly wasted: npm has
 * cli-family 0.1.45/46/47/50 while main reached 0.1.54, so 0.1.48/49/51/52/53
 * were each hand-edited across 11 files and never published.
 *
 * ── MODES ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   (default)            write: stamp platform versions + repoint host pins
 *   --check              verify only, never write; exit 1 on any mismatch
 *   --host <a[,b]>       limit to these hosts (staged rollout; default: all)
 *   --require-snapshot   hard-fail unless the host version is `0.0.0-*`
 *
 * ── --require-snapshot IS NOT VESTIGIAL ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The old script hard-failed whenever the host version was not `0.0.0-*`. That
 * guard was INVERTED into this flag rather than deleted, and the distinction
 * matters: its job is to catch "`changeset version --snapshot` didn't run".
 * Dropped entirely, a canary whose snapshot step silently failed would stamp
 * the platform packages at the STABLE version and publish them to the `canary`
 * dist-tag — a canary resolving stable binaries, which is the exact bug the
 * original docblock was written against. Every canary call site in
 * release.yml must pass it. Stable release-time stamping must not.
