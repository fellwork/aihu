/**
 * check:governed — thesis §3: capability, authority, and rate are declared
 * per-member and ENFORCED BY THE SERVER.
 *
 * Failure modes the property exists to prevent, quoted from the thesis:
 * "enforcement displaced to the browser; a declared control that silently
 * no-ops when its plugin is absent; a check that is structurally always-true."
 *
 * This check is BEHAVIORAL, not static — precisely because `AC11` failed by
 * asserting the INVOKER's rejection rather than the GATE's, and reported green
 * while the allowlist was dead code. Every probe stands up a real
 * `AgentService` (G1) or a real `AgentServer` + bridge channel pair (G2) and
 * asserts the gate's own envelope CODE, never merely that the call didn't
 * succeed.
 *
 * G1 — a declared control whose plugin is absent must DENY.
 *   `$scope` declared / authPlugin omitted      → expect 401 AUTH_MISSING.
 *   `$rate-limit` declared / plugin omitted     → expect a fail-closed denial (429).
 *   NOTHING declared / no plugin                → must DISPATCH.
 *
 * G2 — the bridge handshake must be VERIFIED. An unverified channel that
 *   receives `invoke` frames IS the execution authority, so the server must
 *   refuse to delegate to one. Three channels must be REJECTED (no `hello`;
 *   mismatched protocol; non-numeric protocol) and one — a channel that sent a
 *   valid `hello` — must be DELEGATED to.
 *
 * G3 — rate-limit KEY PROVENANCE (#420 / GO1a). The bucket key must derive
 *   from the signature-VERIFIED JWT `sub` (via `AuthPlugin.verify`), never
 *   from caller-supplied `context.userId`. The probe replays the reported
 *   attack: one credential, rotated caller identities → the SAME bucket,
 *   keyed by the verified sub; an unverifiable credential → 401 with the
 *   limiter never consulted. This is the behavioral form of the "key
 *   provenance" check `check:governed` was explicitly documented NOT to
 *   catch before #420 landed. Verified to FAIL against the pre-fix tree
 *   (git stash of packages/ → self-test's should-not-flag G3 case reports
 *   caller-keyed buckets and the run exits 1).
 *
 * ─── GX Phase 5 (#467) — the governed data boundary (40-spec §10) ───────────
 *
 * G4/G5 make the Phase-4 hard tier NON-REGRESSABLE. Same posture as G1–G3:
 * every probe stands up the REAL `createServerRouter` + `createGovernedRegistry`
 * over the REAL compiled census row (`bench/compiler-conformance/route/
 * 04-governed-data.route.json`, byte-pinned to the compiler by the Rust golden
 * suite `gx_data.rs`) and asserts the gate's own statuses, emission shapes, and
 * spy counters — never merely "the call didn't succeed". Shared fixture:
 * `scripts/lib/governed-fixture.ts` (also consumed by `check:dual-audience`
 * DA-f1, so the two checks measure the same surface).
 *
 * G4a — NO GOVERNED SURFACE REACHES EMISSION UNGATED (invariant I2):
 *   a `data:` route refuses to BOOT without a registry; a malformed census
 *   `data` is a boot refusal (never rounded to ungoverned); an anonymous
 *   request gets the gate's own 401 with the provider NEVER invoked and zero
 *   governed sentinel bytes anywhere in the response; an entitled request is
 *   emitted THROUGH the gate (`$gx.entitled: true`); and `renderToString`
 *   refuses a pending dataSource inside a governed render (GOVERNED_UNGATED —
 *   the I2s streaming seam). Regression proven: census stripped of `data:` +
 *   provider re-exposed as a plain loader (the fan-out-drop regression) leaks
 *   the sentinel to anonymous and is flagged.
 *
 * G4b — non-default `read` + NO auth material + a credentialed request →
 *   deny (the G1 posture at the content boundary: a boundary whose plugin is
 *   absent must fail CLOSED), with a positive control proving the gate is not
 *   "deny everything". Regression proven: an accept-anything `verify` serves
 *   the governed payload and is flagged.
 *
 * G4c — the boundary uses `verify`, never `decodeJwt` (G3's provenance
 *   concern at the content gate): a token whose PAYLOAD decodes to fully
 *   entitled claims but whose signature cannot verify gets 401 with resolver
 *   AND provider untouched. Plus: static-meet-BEFORE-live-resolver ordering
 *   (a wrong-scope token is refused with the resolver never consulted), and
 *   fail-closed reason EXHAUSTIVENESS — the four withheld reasons
 *   (auth/scope/entitlement/unavailable) are each observed with their exact
 *   status (401/403/403/503+Retry-After). Regression proven: a decode-only
 *   `verify` seats the forged principal, leaks the payload, and is flagged
 *   (both the forged cell and the exhaustiveness row).
 *
 * G5a — BUNDLE/STATIC ABSENCE (E6 generalized): drive the REAL `runPrerender`
 *   over a governed route whose provider yields sentinel bytes, then scan
 *   EVERY byte written to `dist/` — governed sentinels absent, provider never
 *   invoked at build time. Regression proven: an inlined-loader-output page
 *   (the "SSG starts embedding governed data" regression) is flagged.
 *
 * G5b — the E3 governed-data endpoint serves the SAME gate decisions as SSR:
 *   anonymous → 401 withheld JSON (no sentinel bytes, `Cache-Control:
 *   private`); entitled → the granted payload; per-principal status AND `$gx`
 *   parity with the SSR channel; non-GET → 405; ungoverned path → 404 (the
 *   endpoint is never a second, open data path). Regression proven: an
 *   always-200 open endpoint stub is flagged on four of five cells.
 *
 * G5c — ENTITLED COMPLETENESS, honestly scoped (#465): entitled server HTML
 *   carries every DIRECT-interpolation governed value (headword, params) and
 *   the loader JSON carries the FULL granted payload. Structural `{#if}`
 *   content renders EMPTY server-side today, so the `senses` sentinel is
 *   load-bearing on the LOADER channel only — the probe AUTO-TIGHTENS: the
 *   moment the structural-directive SSR walk lands (detected by the
 *   `gx-senses` boundary appearing in entitled HTML), the sentinel becomes
 *   required in the HTML channel too. Mirrors the promotion note in
 *   `tests/integration/governed-route-e2e.test.ts`. Regression proven: the
 *   historical pre-P4 seam (render invoked WITHOUT the emission threaded as
 *   props; payload only in the JSON embed) is flagged.
 *
 * ─── Both slices have LANDED (GO1, GO2, 2026-07-19). ────────────────────────
 *
 * This file was updated in the same commit as the fix, because the self-test
 * below was written against the broken tree and would otherwise have gone
 * vacuous the moment the tree went green. Nothing was WEAKENED: the two
 * simulation shims were REMOVED and replaced with stronger, real-behaviour
 * controls in both directions.
 *
 *   Before: the should-not-flag half was a SHIM — a hardcoded
 *     `{ code: 429 }` / early return that simulated the fix the tree did not
 *     yet have. It proved the assertion logic could observe a pass; it could
 *     not prove the SERVER could produce one.
 *
 *   After: the should-not-flag half is the REAL, unmutated tree, and the
 *     should-flag half REGRESSES it using real code paths only — no shim
 *     anywhere:
 *       G1 regression: inject an always-permissive `rateLimitPlugin`, which
 *         reproduces exactly what the old `&& rateLimitPlugin` guard produced —
 *         a declared control that does not enforce.
 *       G2 regression: send a VALID `hello` first. The pre-fix server treated
 *         every channel as delegable; a post-fix server treats a handshaken one
 *         that way. The regression is therefore the real server's real
 *         delegation path, not a stand-in for it.
 *
 * The discrimination proof was likewise re-based rather than dropped. It used
 * to read "$scope denies, $rate-limit does not" — an assertion that only held
 * while the bug did. It now asserts the axis that actually matters and that a
 * broken gate cannot fake: DECLARED-with-absent-plugin denies, UNDECLARED
 * dispatches, and the two declared controls deny with DIFFERENT codes (401 vs
 * 429) so they are provably two separate checks rather than one blanket rule.
 * A gate that denied everything, or allowed everything, fails it.
 *
 * NO suppression comments are supported.
 *
 * Wired into CI (plan-a.yml `check` job). Run manually:
 *   bun run check:governed

// That flag is load-bearing, and the reason is not obvious. `@aihu/*` is NOT
// linked into `node_modules` (the install is isolated; `node_modules/@aihu`
// does not exist), so resolution falls to tsconfig `paths`. Bun applies the
// tsconfig NEAREST each file, and the per-package ones — e.g.
// `packages/arbor/tsconfig.json` — omit `baseUrl`, which makes bun ignore
// their `paths` entirely. So the entry's own imports resolve fine while a
// TRANSITIVE one dies: `packages/arbor/src/mount.ts` importing `@aihu/signals`
// fails. `--tsconfig-override` forces the root map on every file and fixes it.
//
// Without the flag this script does not merely mis-measure, it CRASHES before
