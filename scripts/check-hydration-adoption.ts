/**
 * check:hydration-adoption — assert the CLIENT ADOPTS the server's DOM.
 *
 * The fifth thesis invariant (FEL-249 / #421). The other four can all report
 * green while a human looking at the page sees every word twice.
 *
 * None of them closes this gap:
 *   `check:derived`        — agent artifacts are generated, not mirrored
 *   `check:attributed`     — tool calls carry a caller identity
 *   `check:governed`       — declared controls fail closed
 *   `check:dual-audience`  — markers are PRESENT in the served bytes
 *
 * `check:dual-audience` is the near miss, and the distinction is the whole
 * reason this file exists. It asserts the server EMITS `data-aihu-path`
 * markers. It cannot assert the client can USE them. Those came apart in
 * production: `@aihu/server` seeded its path walk with `'0'` while
 * `@aihu/arbor`'s `hydrate()` hardcoded `'hydrate.0'`, so the markers were
 * present, well-formed, and addressed a key space the client never asked
 * about. Every dual-audience assertion would have passed on that HTML.
 *
 * The failure mode is SILENT, which is why it needs a checker rather than a
 * stack trace. A missed path lookup is not an error — `_hydrateNode` reads it
 * as a legitimate DOM mismatch and falls back to `_materialize`, which builds
 * a second copy of the subtree and appends it. Nothing throws. The server's
 * DOM stays on the page, a duplicate lands beside it, and the only witness is
 * a human reading the same paragraph twice.
 *
 * So the assertions here are deliberately about ADOPTION, not presence:
 *
 *   1. `host.innerHTML` is BYTE-IDENTICAL across `hydrate()`. `_materialize`
 *      cannot append without changing it.
 *   2. Node IDENTITY is preserved — the root element object after hydration is
 *      the same object the server's HTML parsed into, not a replacement.
 *   3. The primary text appears EXACTLY ONCE. This is the user-visible
 *      symptom, asserted directly rather than inferred. `toContain` would pass
 *      on duplicated content, which is precisely the bug.
 *   4. Reactive writes drive the SERVER's own Text node. A rebuild wires the
 *      effect to the duplicate, leaving the visible node frozen at its
 *      server-rendered value.
 *
 * Two probes, because the chain has two production entry points and a fix to
 * one does not fix the other:
 *   HA-a — `renderToString(…, { hydratable: true })` → `hydrate()`   (CO5)
 *   HA-b — the LIVE `createServerRouter` handler     → `hydrate()`   (CO5+DA3)
 *
 * HA-b is the end-to-end one: it drives the real router, takes the bytes off
 * the real `Response`, and hydrates those. It is the only assertion in the
 * repo that the shipped pipeline produces HTML the shipped client can adopt.
 *
 * `SCRIBE_NATIVE_SKIP=1` selects the TypeScript SSR fallback ("slower, always
 * correct"), matching what `vitest.config.ts` and `check:dual-audience` set for
 * the same reason: the native renderer binary is not built in a plain checkout.
 * Run via the npm script, NOT bare bun:
 *   bun run check:hydration-adoption
 *
 * NO suppression comments are supported.

/**
 * `live` measures PRODUCTION and is what the real scan uses. The other two are
 * SELF-TEST controls only.
 *
 * The controls deliberately do NOT reuse the live path. A self-test whose
 * should-not-flag arm is production conflates two different questions — "can
 * this checker tell adoption from a rebuild?" and "does production adopt?" —
 * and answers the second one first. `check:check-dual-audience` was built that
 * way and had to be re-based the moment its defect was fixed; worse, a genuine
 * production regression there surfaces as "SELF-TEST FAILED / the check cannot
 * discriminate", which points at the checker instead of at the bug.
 *
 * So the controls below are keyed to `_ROOT_PATH` rather than to a literal:
 *   `agreeing`  — markers rewritten to whatever root the client currently asks
 *                 for. Proves the checker RECOGNIZES adoption. A no-op while
 *                 the two sides agree, and self-repairing if they ever diverge,
 *                 so it tests the checker and never production.
 *   `disagreeing` — every marker prefixed with a sentinel that cannot collide
 *                 with any real key. Reproduces the pre-CO5 defect: markers
 *                 present, well-formed, addressing a key space the client never
 *                 queries. This is the exact shape `check:dual-audience` cannot
 *                 see, and the reason this check exists.
 *   `markerless` — rendered with `{ hydratable: false }`, the pre-DA3 state.
