// @vitest-environment node
//
// NOT jsdom (the repo default). The whole claim under test is what a recipe's
// setup body does when `HTMLElement` / `CSSStyleSheet` / `customElements` do
// NOT exist. Under jsdom every assertion here would pass vacuously against the
// exact bug it exists to catch.

/**
 * Every shipped recipe must SERVER-RENDER without a DOM.
 *
 * ## What broke
 *
 * `card.aihu`, `badge.aihu`, `separator.aihu` and `button.aihu` each declared a
 * custom-element class inside `@state` — `class AihuCard extends HTMLElement`,
 * `static sheet = new CSSStyleSheet()`, `customElements.define(…)`. The
 * compiler emits an `@state` block VERBATIM into `__aihu_setup__` and
 * `__aihu_ssr_string_setup__`, i.e. into the body every server render runs. So
 * under `output: 'ssr'` those three lines threw
 * `ReferenceError: HTMLElement is not defined` on a Cloudflare Worker — as a
 * child, the element rendered empty; as a page, the whole request died.
 *
 * `before-after.aihu` and `temperature.aihu` had the same disease with a
 * different symptom: they call `@aihu/primitives`' own `defineSlider()` /
 * `defineRadioGroup()` from `@state`, and those threw
 * `ReferenceError: customElements is not defined` one frame deeper.
 *
 * This is NOT the `$extends` bug (`.changeset/ssr-extends-base-guard.md`).
 * That one threw at module LOAD, because the class sat at the primitive
 * module's own top level and an extends clause is evaluated on import. This one
 * throws at SETUP-BODY EXECUTION, which happens for every server-rendered
 * component whether or not it has a `base:` clause.
 *
 * ## Why this file executes rather than pattern-matches
 *
 * A regex over the emitted source would pin today's four files and nothing
 * else — a new recipe reaching for `matchMedia` or `new ResizeObserver()` at
 * setup time is the same bug and would sail past. So this compiles each recipe
 * with the REAL compiler binary at the REAL server target and CALLS the
 * emitted renderers in a DOM-less realm. Whatever a recipe touches, it is
 * touched here.
 *
 * `packages/app/tests/workers-ssr-e2e.test.ts` (assertions 16–18) covers the
 * other axis — a real `vite build`, driven as a built Worker — for the shapes
 * these recipes use. That gate is ~30s and exercises probe components; this one
 * is seconds and exercises every file actually shipped.
