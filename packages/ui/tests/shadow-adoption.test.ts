/**
 * R2 (shadow CSS attachment) + registration ownership — against the REAL
 * compiled recipe, loaded in a DOM.
 *
 * ## What this file used to do, and why that was worse than no test
 *
 * The previous version re-declared `button.aihu`'s `@state` class BY HAND in
 * TypeScript (`class AihuButtonRecipe extends AihuButton { static sheet = … }`),
 * called `customElements.define` on it itself, and asserted the resulting
 * element adopted a shared sheet. Every assertion passed. None of them
 * described production:
 *
 *   1. The recipe's own class NEVER registers in a real build. The compiler
 *      emits `defineElement('aihu-button', …)` at MODULE scope; a `@state`
 *      block is emitted into the *setup* body, which the runtime calls only
 *      when an element UPGRADES — strictly afterwards. By then
 *      `customElements.get('aihu-button')` is already truthy, so the recipe's
 *      `if (!customElements.get(…)) customElements.define(…)` was skipped on
 *      every single instance, forever. The test registered the class that the
 *      shipped code path never registers.
 *   2. Its "shared stylesheet" was EMPTY. `static sheet = new CSSStyleSheet()`
 *      was never `replaceSync`'d with anything, so even in the fictional world
 *      where it registered, it adopted zero rules.
 *   3. jsdom 25 exposes a `CSSStyleSheet` constructor but implements neither
 *      `replaceSync` nor a real `adoptedStyleSheets` accessor — so
 *      `shadowRoot.adoptedStyleSheets = [sheet]` was a plain expando write and
 *      `toContain(sheet)` read it straight back. The assertion could not have
 *      failed.
 *
 * The dead `@state` blocks are gone (see `.changeset/registry-dead-registration.md`).
 * This file is rebuilt to assert what actually ships.
 *
 * ## What this file does now
 *
 * Compiles each of the four styled recipes with the REAL `aihu-compile` binary
 * at the REAL client target, loads the emitted module, upgrades two instances,
 * and asserts against those:
 *
 *   R2a  the shadow root adopts exactly one sheet, carrying the recipe's own
 *        compiled `@style` rules (checked by rule text, not by identity with
 *        something the test built);
 *   R2b  that sheet is the SAME object across two instances — module-scope
 *        single construction, not per-instance;
 *   REG  `customElements.define` is called exactly ONCE for the tag, by the
 *        compiler, at module evaluation — and upgrading instances adds no
 *        further registration.
 *
 * `CSSStyleSheet` is shimmed (jsdom has no usable one — see 3 above) but the
 * shim is a RECORDER, not a stand-in for the assertion: it stores the text the
 * compiled module passes to `replaceSync`, and the test asserts that text
 * contains the recipe's real selectors. Real-browser confirmation that those
 * rules actually paint is the Storybook + axe gate (`bun run check:a11y`),
 * which drives all four recipes in chromium.
