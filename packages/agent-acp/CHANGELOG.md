# @aihu/agent-acp

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#455](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/pull/455) [`5b2f3c7`](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/commit/5b2f3c7d95c3e8075b53137eb7f87f436d5fcb28) Thanks [@srmcguirt](https://github.com/srmcguirt)! - **DEPRECATED — use `@aihu/agent-a2a` instead** ([#428](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/issues/428)).

  The ACP protocol this package targeted (BeeAI ACP) merged into the A2A protocol
  under the Linux Foundation in August 2025 — its maintainers migrated, and there
  is no independent ACP spec left to conform to. (The "ACP" name now belongs to
  Zed's unrelated editor↔agent Agent Client Protocol, which this package never
  implemented; the package had also accumulated three conflicting name expansions
  across its own docs.)

  The package is frozen at `0.1.x`: it still compiles, its routes still respond,
  and the AT1 tier-0 `RequestContext` attribution remains intact and tested — but
  no further features will land. `package.json` now carries a `deprecated` notice;
  run `npm deprecate @aihu/agent-acp` at publish time with the same message.

  **Migration:** mount `mountA2aAdapter` from `@aihu/agent-a2a` on the same
  `AgentService`. The A2A adapter implements the A2A v1.0.1 JSON-RPC binding and
  accepts the same `resolveAuth` injection point.

  The ~293 lines of tests that validated the adapter's invented wire shape were
  deleted (not rewritten — they locked in a shape with no spec behind it). The
  attribution/argument-threading suite (`tests/attribution.test.ts`) is kept in
  full.
