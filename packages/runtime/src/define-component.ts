 * First-render DOM adoption — the server's template marker.
 *
 * A WIRE-PROTOCOL attribute (like `data-aihu-path`): `@aihu/server`'s
 * `renderToString({ wrapTag })` stamps it on the component's own host element
 * in hydratable renders, declaring "this host's children are its OWN
 * server-rendered template". That declaration is what makes adoption safe to
 * detect at all: under light DOM the host's children at connect time are
 * otherwise the SLOT-PROJECTION source (user-slotted content), and slotted
 * content that itself came from a parent's server render carries
 * `data-aihu-path` markers too — path presence alone cannot tell the two
 * apart. The marker can, because it only ever rides the host of a render the
 * server produced FOR that host; slotted content arrives inside a parent's
 * template and its receiving host is never marked.
 *
 * Consequences, both directions:
 *   - marked host → children are NEVER slot-projected. Adopt them when
 *     possible; DISCARD them when not (shadow mode, no hydrate fn wired) —
 *     re-projecting a server template as slot content would double-render it.
 *   - unmarked host → children are ALWAYS the slot source (existing carve).
 *
 * The attribute is deliberately NOT consumed on adoption: sibling renders
 * hydrate in load order, and an outer component's `hydrate()` needs the
 * nested host's marker as a path-map boundary (see arbor's hydrate.ts) even
 * if the nested host adopted first. A disconnect→reconnect over a marked host
 * is safe because the adopted scope's dispose clears the host's children
 * (parity with mount()'s DOM removal), so re-adoption over the empty host
 * degrades to a fresh materialize — i.e. a clean mount.

 * signals; its ABSENCE no longer gates adoption (static pages have no
 * serialized state but every reason to keep their prerendered DOM).
 *
 * The returned scope's dispose removes the host's children after the effect
 * teardown — mount()-parity (its dispose removes the mounted roots last).
 * hydrate()'s own scope deliberately leaves DOM intact, but for a COMPONENT
 * host that would break reconnect: the first hydration consumes structural
 * comment markers, so a second hydration over the stale DOM would append
 * fresh structural content beside the stale copy. Clearing makes any later
 * reconnect a clean re-render.
 *

 *
 * Non-emptiness IS the discriminator, and it is exact for the roots aihu
