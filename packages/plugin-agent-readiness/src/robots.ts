/**
 * robots.txt generation with a TIERED bot policy (#430, extended by GX Phase 2).
 *
 * Every known crawler user agent is classified by what it actually is:
 *
 *   - `searcher` — traditional search-index crawlers (Googlebot, Bingbot, …).
 *     Never listed in `AI_BOT_LIST` and never targeted by the AI policies;
 *     the tier exists so the GX `read:` axis can tell "search" apart from
 *     "AI fetch" and "training" (spec §2.1: the `'search'` value).
 *   - `user-fetcher` — agents that fetch on behalf of a user action or surface
 *     cited search results back to users (ChatGPT-User, OAI-SearchBot,
 *     DuckAssistBot, Applebot). Allowed under the `'allow-agents'` default.
 *   - `training-crawler` — autonomous crawlers that gather content for model
 *     training or bulk scraping (GPTBot, CCBot, Bytespider, …). Explicit
 *     opt-in: disallowed under the `'allow-agents'` default.
 *
 * ONE registry (`BOT_REGISTRY`) drives robots.txt generation, content
 * negotiation (`isAiCrawlerUserAgent`), and the GX principal gate's anonymous
 * UA classification (`classifyBotUserAgent` → `resolvePrincipal` in
 * `@aihu/agent-service`). A second bot list anywhere would be exactly the
 * hand-maintained sync seam `check:derived` exists to forbid.
 *
 * GX Phase 3 (#437-GX): robots.txt output is now DERIVED per route from the
 * compiled `extract.read` axis (spec §8). Pass the compiled route table as
 * `RobotsConfig.routes` and each route's declared `read:` value fans out into
 * per-path directives over the tiered registry — one declaration, no
 * hand-maintained path lists. See {@link deriveRouteDirectives} for the
 * per-value mapping. With no `routes` (or with every route at the recorded
 * default `read: 'agents'`) the output is byte-identical to #430's tiered
 * default.
 *
 * NOTE: robots.txt is ADVISORY (RFC 9309 compliance is voluntary) — the
 * compliance tier of the honest ceiling (spec §1.1): it binds exactly the
 * crawlers that identify themselves and honor it; a UA-spoofer is unaffected.
 * CDN-layer controls — e.g. Cloudflare's default AI-crawler blocking —
 * override whatever is emitted here. Hard enforcement of the verified `read`
 * values is Phase 4 (SSR withholding + the bundle/data boundary), NOT this
 * file. See docs/site/agent-discovery.md §robots.txt.
