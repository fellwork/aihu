//
// NOT jsdom (the repo default). A Worker has no `customElements`, and the
// compiled server target guards its registration on `typeof customElements`.
// Under jsdom the guard passes, both built workers register the SAME page tag
// into ONE shared registry, and the second one to load throws SCR-R0001
// (`already: probe-page`) — which is exactly what happened, and is an artifact
// of the test host rather than anything a deployed worker would ever hit. The

/**
 * THE CI GATE for `output: 'ssr'` — a real `vite build`, driven in-process.
 *
 * ## Why this file lives here and not in `examples/`
 *
 * The root vitest config includes `packages/*&#47;tests/**` and NOT `examples/**`,
 * and the `examples` CI job walks two hardcoded directory lists inside a lane a
 * `changes` filter can skip entirely. A test in the example would gate nothing
 * on most PRs. Here it is gated for free by the job everyone already runs.
 *
 * ## Why a subprocess
 *
 * Same reason as `packages/compiler/tests/vite-build-utility-css.e2e.test.ts`:
 * vitest's runtime intercepts `await import('vite')` in a way that breaks the
 * compiler plugin's TS-strip. A spawned `vite build` is the exact execution
 * context a consumer's `bun run build` has, which is the contract under test.
 *
 * ## Why no wrangler / workerd
 *
 * `scripts/serve-dist.ts` documents why wrangler was deliberately ejected from
 * CI: compat-date drift, ~246 cold packages, blown timeouts. Same reason
 * `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` is not the route here. The worker is a standard ES
 * module exporting `{ fetch }`, so `import()`ing it and calling `fetch` with a
 * stubbed `ASSETS` exercises everything except workerd's own module resolution
 * — and assertion 4 (no node builtin in the bundle) is what stands in for that.
 *
 * ## THROWS, never skips
 *
 * `vite-build-utility-css.e2e.test.ts`'s own comment names soft-skipping as
 * "the false-confidence pattern that let the prior Bug 2 fix ship a non-working
 * feature." Every prerequisite below is either satisfied or a red bar. In
 * particular the package `dist/`s are REBUILT rather than assumed: `@aihu/app`,
 * `@aihu/router` and `@aihu/adapter-cloudflare` are consumed through their
 * `exports` (i.e. `dist/`), the repo's own CI runs `bun run test` BEFORE
 * `bun run build`, and `packages/router/dist/plugin.js` has previously shipped
 * without an export its `src` had. A stale dist would make this file validate
 * the last release instead of this change.

/**
 * `import()` a built worker UNDER A TIMEOUT.
 *
 * ## Why the bound exists, and why it is not optional
 *
 * The SSR entry used to resolve its child and layout registries with
 * module-scope top-level `await`. That makes `_worker.js` an ESM async module —
 * and vite/rollup hoists the shared runtime INTO the entry chunk, so the lazy
 * chunks statically import back into `_worker.js` (7 of 8, measured on vite
 * 6.4.3 in a consumer-shaped tree). The cycle then cannot resolve: the entry
 * suspends at its top-level await; the dynamically imported chunk cannot finish
 * evaluating until the entry's evaluation promise settles; and that settles
 * only when the dynamic import resolves.
 *
 * The consequence for THIS FILE is what matters. An unbounded
 * `await import(worker)` against such a build does not fail — it HANGS, and a
 * hung CI job is not a red test. It is a job someone cancels an hour later and
 * reruns. So the class of bug that ships a green build whose Worker cannot be
 * loaded was, structurally, invisible here.
 *
 * The bound converts that into a named failure. Note it also stops being
 * bundler-luck-dependent: vite 8/rolldown happens to extract the runtime into
 * standalone chunks so the entry is a leaf with zero back-edges, which is the
 * only reason this gate passed on 8 while the same source deadlocked on 6.
 *
 * The abandoned `import()` is deliberately not cancelled — it cannot be. A
 * deadlocked module holds no timer or handle, so leaving it pending does not
 * keep the process alive.
