/**
 * Config validation combinators.
 *
 * Ported from SvelteKit's `packages/kit/src/core/config/options.js`, which is
 * the best-in-class implementation of this and is ~30 lines at its core. The
 * properties worth having, none of which we had before:
 *
 *   1. **Unknown keys throw, with a keypath and a targeted "did you mean".**
 *      `AihuConfigError`'s `UNKNOWN_FIELD` code was declared and never thrown;
 *      a typo'd key was silently ignored. That matters much more now that
 *      `aihu.config.ts` is scaffolded into every project and advertised as THE
 *      customization surface — a silently-dropped field reads as a broken
 *      feature.
 *
 *   2. **Key ownership derives from the schema**, not a hand-maintained list.
 *      `Object.keys(SCHEMA)` is the set of fields aihu owns; nothing can drift.
 *
 *   3. **A machine-readable deprecation lifecycle.** We are pre-1.0 with fields
 *      marked "RESERVED for v2" and "accepted but ignored" in prose only.
 *      `deprecated()` warns and passes through; `removed()` throws.
 *
 * Deliberate deviation from SvelteKit: their validators double as
 * default-appliers, so `validate({}, 'config')` returns a fully-defaulted
 * object. Ours **validate only and return the caller's object unchanged**.
 * `defineConfig` has always been an identity function and several call sites
 * rely on that (`viteAihuPlugin` reads `config?.dir?.pages ?? 'pages'` and
 * friends, applying its own defaults at point of use). Making defineConfig
 * start returning a different object is a behaviour change that belongs in its
 * own PR, not smuggled in with validation.
 *
 * Unknown keys THROW rather than warn. Next.js chose warn for its zod schema
 * and it visibly cost them — users learned to ignore the banner and at least
 * one popular config composer shipped broken because a warning wasn't loud
 * enough to stop it. We are pre-1.0; throw.
