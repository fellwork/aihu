/**
 * SSG prerender (B4, SEO arc) — build-time only.
 *
 * When `output: 'static'`, this module runs in `viteAihuPlugin`'s `closeBundle`
 * after Vite has written the SPA build. For every STATIC route it:
 *
 *   1. Loads the route's REAL module by file path (via a short-lived Vite SSR
 *      module loader — this compiles `.aihu`/`.ts` exactly like the dev/prod
 *      pipeline). The `AdapterContext.routes` stub is NOT used here.
 *   2. Renders the route's component to content HTML with @aihu/server's
 *      `renderToString`.
 *   3. Folds the route's `<head>` (from the `.route.json` sidecar) into a
 *      renderable `HeadConfig` via `routeHeadToSsrHead`, resolving relative
 *      canonical/OG/Twitter URLs against `site.url`.
 *   4. Uses the built `index.html` as a template — injecting the per-page head
 *      into `<head>` and the rendered content into the SPA outlet — so the page
 *      ships content-ful HTML for crawlers/agents AND keeps the client bundle
 *      `<script>` tags that hydrate it into the live SPA (progressive
 *      enhancement).
 *   5. Writes `<pattern>/index.html` (and `index.html` for `/`).
 *
 * Dynamic routes (`:param` / `[param]`) are prerendered only when their module
 * exports `getStaticPaths()`; otherwise they are SKIPPED with a build warning.
 *
 * This module is build-time only (no DOM, never shipped to the client) — it
 * does NOT get a `.size-limit.json` row.

 * can drift from what `defineElement` registered; a registry keyed on a guess
 * would silently miss exactly the components whose tag does not match their
 * file stem.
 *
 * Every component is loaded, rather than walking `__aihu_child_tags__`
 * transitively from each page. This is simplicity, not necessity — the real
 * reasons, not the circular "the tags cannot be read without loading them
 * anyway" this docblock used to give (true, but only because load-all was
 * already the design):
 *   - `buildChildRegistry`'s cycle check wants a GLOBAL view of the component
 *     graph. A cycle that runs through a component no page directly
 *     references is still a cycle; a per-page transitive walk would only see
 *     the components reachable from that one page and could miss it.
 *   - The extra cost is negligible for an SSG build: every `.aihu` file under
 *     the components dir is already compiled by Vite as part of the build,
 *     so loading it too is marginal, not additive (§17 also overlaps it with
 *     `Promise.all` instead of paying it serially).
 * That trade is WRONG for a Workers build, which cannot bundle every
 * component artifact whether or not a live request ever reaches it — this
 * function is the SSG-only caller. `packages/server/src/child-registry.ts`'s
 * docblock is explicit that a Workers build supplies its own tag→module
 * manifest instead of a discovery walk like this one.
 *
 * A module that fails to load does not fail the whole prerender: one broken
 * component should cost that component's markup, not the build.
 * `__aihu_schild` then fails closed on its tag, which is exactly today's
 * behaviour. The failure is reported in `failures` rather than warned here —
 * whether it deserves a warning depends on whether anything discovered
 * actually references its tag (§18), which needs the full set of
 * successfully-loaded components' `__aihu_child_tags__` and so can only be
 * decided by the caller, after this function returns.
