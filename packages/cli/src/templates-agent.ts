/**
 * `--template agent` generators — the agent-drivable showcase.
 *
 * Unlike the client-only `minimal`/`full`/`docs` templates (Vite + viteAihuPlugin
 * + pages router), the `agent` template is the headline aihu thesis made runnable:
 * a durable on-screen Web Component that BOTH a human and an external AI agent
 * drive. The agent reads + reskins the SAME visible instance over a server-mediated
 * capability bridge — the Bun server (`server.ts`) is the sole policy gate; the
 * browser instance is the sole executor.
 *
 * Two entries, two stories:
 *   - server.ts — the GOVERNED HTTP entry. The component's actions are gated with
 *     an auth scope + a rate limit, so `/agent/call` demonstrates 200 (authorized) /
 *     403 (no scope) / 429 (rate-limited). This is the "every guardrail is real" story.
 *   - mcp.ts    — the OPEN MCP entry (stdio). Serves the same actions as MCP tools so
 *     a standard AI client (Claude, Cursor) can discover + drive the live instance
 *     with zero auth friction — the "an agent molds the component" story.
 *
 * It is a two-process app: `bun run dev` runs the Bun bridge server (:5208) AND
 * Vite (:5108, proxying `/agent` + `/bridge`). Ported from the in-repo reference
 * `examples/agent-driven-demo`, adapted for a standalone (non-workspace) app and
 * extended with human controls + agent reskinning.
 *
 * Per the repo's dep-free thesis: pure string generators, no runtime file reads.
 * Generated files deliberately avoid template literals (string concatenation) so
 * these generators don't need nested-backtick escaping.

 * connects to, and serves MCP over stdout — so all human-facing logging goes to

 *
 * Run the page separately (`vite --port 5108`), register `bun mcp.ts` with your
 * MCP client (see README), open the page, then ask the AI to reskin the component.
