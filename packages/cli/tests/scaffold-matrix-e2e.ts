/**
 * Scaffold DX matrix — the end-to-end first-impression harness.
 *
 * `npm create aihu` is the first command a developer ever runs against this
 * project. Everything downstream of it (install → typecheck → build → dev
 * server → production preview) is the first-impression path, and until this
 * file existed none of it was covered past `bun run build` on bun alone:
 *
 *   - `scaffold-npm-e2e.ts`     bun only, stops at a `dist/` existence check,
 *                               never starts a server.
 *   - `scaffold-default-e2e.ts` in-process `scaffoldApp()` from local source.
 *
 * This harness runs the full grid instead:
 *
 *   package managers  bun | npm | pnpm | yarn
 *   scaffold paths    create-aihu templates  minimal | full | docs | agent | ssr
 *                     `aihu app --template`  cf-team  (resolved FROM npm)
 *
 * and every cell is driven all the way to a *serving HTTP server*: the dev
 * server and the production preview server must each answer 200 with a
 * non-empty HTML body before the cell is allowed to pass.
 *
 * ── Design rules this file is built around ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  1. Everything runs in a temp dir with NO aihu ancestor. `resolveTemplatePackagePath()`
 *     (packages/cli/src/bin.ts) falls back to walking up for
 *     `packages/templates/<short>` — run inside the monorepo, that fallback
 *     silently substitutes the workspace template and masks a broken npm
 *     publish entirely. `assertNoAihuAncestor()` refuses to start if the temp
 *     root is anywhere under a checkout.
 *  2. A hang is never a pass. Every command and every server wait is bounded
 *     by an explicit timeout, and readiness is established by *polling the HTTP
 *     endpoint until it answers*, never by sleeping. On timeout the server's
 *     captured stdout+stderr is printed.
 *  3. Ports are ephemeral and per-cell, and children are spawned into their own
 *     process group so the whole group can be killed on every path — success,
 *     failure, throw, and process-level SIGINT/SIGTERM.
 *  4. Assertions are on exit codes and response bodies. Nothing in this file
 *     decides pass/fail by grepping log text: a substring match against an
 *     error message reads as success, which is how a harness ends up green on
 *     a broken release.
 *  5. One cell's failure never aborts the matrix. Results are collected, the
 *     grid is printed, and the process exits non-zero if any cell failed.
 *  6. A step that cannot run is `skip` or `n/a` with a printed reason. It is
 *     never silently counted as a pass.
 *

 * on its response. That model could not have caught the defect this step is
 * here for: the SSR deadlock lived in the BUILT `_worker.js`, which no vite dev
 * server ever loads. `vite build` was green, `vite preview` was green, and the
 * artifact that would be deployed could not be imported at all.
 *
 * ## Why not wrangler/workerd
 *
 * Same reasoning as `packages/app/tests/workers-ssr-e2e.test.ts`, which this is
 * the consumer-shaped sibling of: the Worker is a standard ES module exporting
 * `{ fetch }`, so importing it and calling `fetch` with a stubbed ASSETS
 * exercises everything but workerd's own module resolution, at a fraction of
 * the cold-start cost a matrix cell can afford.
 *
 * ## Why the import is bounded
 *
 * A module-scope top-level await inside a chunk cycle does not throw — it
 * HANGS. An unbounded `await import()` would turn a broken Worker into a job
 * someone cancels an hour later, and a cancelled job is not a red test.
