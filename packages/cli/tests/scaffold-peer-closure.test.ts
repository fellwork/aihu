/**
 * C-FEL-SCAFFOLD-PM-COMPAT — the scaffold must declare the TRANSITIVE PEER
 * CLOSURE of what it lists, not one package's peer list.
 *
 * `@aihu/app`, `@aihu/runtime` and `@aihu/arbor` each declare **zero** runtime
 * `dependencies` and express every edge as a `peerDependency`. Nothing installs
 * a peer on the consumer's behalf except the package manager, and only some of
 * them do it: npm 7+, pnpm and bun auto-install peers; **yarn 1 does not**. So
 * an omission here is invisible on three of four package managers and fatal on
 * the fourth — which is exactly how it reached main twice.
 *
 * This test walks the real workspace manifests rather than hardcoding a list,
 * so adding a peer to any of those packages fails HERE — at `bun run test`, in
 * seconds — instead of thirty minutes later in one yarn cell of the scaffold
 * matrix, or not at all until a user hits it.
 *
 * Two rounds of this defect were found one layer apart and each time the fix
 * merely relocated the error message:
 *   run 30322552896  yarn build → Cannot find package '@aihu/store'
 *   run 30333109465  yarn build → failed to resolve import "@aihu/context"
 *                                 from @aihu/runtime
 * Hence a closure, not another name.
