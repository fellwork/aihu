# @aihu/cli

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#601](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/pull/601) [`5720298`](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/commit/572029884dca3bc381f09936431afcd28ae989f3) Thanks [@srmcguirt](https://github.com/srmcguirt)! - **`--template agent`: give the agent template an agent-readiness surface, and fix its gate.**

  The template named for agents was the only one with no discovery surface — the generic
  `full` template had one, `agent` had none. An agent handed the app's URL could not find
  out what the app was or how to call it. It now serves the full surface, and two of its
  own headline flows that were broken are fixed.

  **Discovery, served live rather than emitted statically.** `readiness.ts` wires
  `@aihu-plugin/agent-readiness`'s `createAgentReadinessRoutes()` into `server.ts` and
  `mcp.ts`, and `vite.config.ts` proxies the paths so they answer on the app's own URL:

  | Path                                                                              | Content-Type       |
  | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
  | `/llms.txt`, `/llms-full.txt`, `/robots.txt`                                      | `text/plain`       |
  | `/sitemap.xml`                                                                    | `application/xml`  |
  | `/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json`                                               | `application/json` |
  | `/.well-known/agent-card.json` (+ the deprecated `/.well-known/agent.json` alias) | `application/json` |
  | `/.well-known/mcp.json`                                                           | `application/json` |

  This template deliberately does not use `viteAgentReadinessIntegration()` the way
  `minimal`/`full`/`docs` do. That integration emits the documents from a browser-target
  build, where the `@aihu/agent` registry is empty — the files would exist and advertise
  zero tools. Serving them from the process that calls `registerAgentMetadata()` means the
  MCP card's tools, the A2A card's skills and llms.txt's `## Components` section are all
  derived from the same registry the `/agent/call` gate authorizes against, so the
  advertised surface cannot drift from the callable one.

  Also in this template:

  - **`/agent/call` was returning 401 `AUTH_UNVERIFIABLE` for every call**, authorized or
    not — the whole documented 404/401/403/429/200 ladder was dead. `@aihu/agent-service`
    will not serve a scoped or rate-limited tool through an auth plugin that cannot
    signature-verify a credential, and the template's demo plugin only implemented
    `checkScope`. It now implements `verify` as well.
  - **The A2A card was emitted with no skills**; it is now handed the registry-derived list,
    so both cards describe the same surface.
  - `registerAgentMetadata` actions carry their `describe:` text, so the MCP tool
    descriptions are populated instead of empty strings.
  - Documented that `/agent/call` always answers HTTP 200 with the outcome in the body's
    `code`, and that the rate-limit key is the verified subject — not the caller-supplied
    `userId`, which rotating does not reset the quota.

- [#609](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/pull/609) [`bef4c66`](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/commit/bef4c66fb59c8d9224d131e158106713cdb0da05) Thanks [@srmcguirt](https://github.com/srmcguirt)! - Config lives in `vite.config.ts`; the CLI reads it from there

  The scaffold no longer emits a separate `aihu.config.ts`. Everything aihu is
  configured with goes inline on `viteAihuPlugin({...})` in `vite.config.ts`, and
  non-Vite consumers read it back from there.

  A second config file is justified exactly as long as something other than Vite
  needs the config and cannot parse the Vite config. That was SvelteKit's stated
  reason for `svelte.config.js` in 2022 — the language server had to know your
  preprocessors and does not run Vite. SvelteKit then removed the reason rather
  than living with it: once the language server could read `vite.config.js`, the
  second file became optional, and SvelteKit 3 makes the Vite config the required
  location.

  **New in `@aihu/app`:**

  - `viteAihuPlugin()` registers an `aihu:config` marker plugin carrying the
    evaluated config on a public `api` handle.
  - `loadAihuConfig(root)` reads it back through Vite's own `loadConfigFromFile`
    — no build. Returns the config, its source path, Vite's dependency list, and
    every registered aihu module's options.
  - `declareAihuModule()` + `collectAihuModules()`: the contract by which any
    package becomes readable by the CLI and the language server without a central
    registry to update.
  - `viteAihuPlugin()` now validates its inline argument. Only `defineConfig` did
    before, so the path every example uses was unvalidated. Unknown keys throw
    with a keypath and a did-you-mean.
  - New options that previously required abandoning `viteAihuPlugin` and wiring
    the underlying plugin by hand: `dir.components`, `compiler.islands`,
    `compiler.target`, `build.bundler`, `dev.*`, `typecheck.*`.

  **In `@aihu/cli`:** `aihu build` and `aihu dev` each had a private loader that
  dynamic-imported `aihu.config.ts` with its own local interface. They now share
  one loader that prefers `vite.config.ts` and falls back to `aihu.config.ts`, so
  existing projects keep working.

  **Also:** the scaffolded config declares no MCP `endpoint`. The previous one
  pointed `endpoint` at the server card's own URL, publishing a card that
  advertised zero tools and named the discovery document as its own transport.
  A static client build has no process to serve MCP, so no card is emitted.

- [#600](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/pull/600) [`3ed4072`](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/commit/3ed407299c68644cb522d919204b4f4a3f96025e) Thanks [@srmcguirt](https://github.com/srmcguirt)! - `create-aihu --template` now spans both template tiers.

  npm users could only ever reach the built-in templates. The npm-published
  `@aihu/templates-*` tier was reachable only through `aihu app --template <pkg>`,
  and that command cannot run under npx at all:

  ```
  $ npx -y @aihu/cli@latest app my-app --template cf-team
  npm error could not determine executable to run
  ```

  npx infers the executable from the package NAME — for `@aihu/cli` it looks for
  a bin called `cli`, and the bins are `aihu` and `create-aihu`. `bunx` resolves
  differently, so the failure was npm-only. `create-aihu` is the entry point npm
  users actually reach, so it is now the complete one:

  ```
  npm create aihu my-app -- --template cf-team
  npx create-aihu my-app --template cf-team
  ```

  Both tiers run the SAME scaffold pipeline, factored out of `bin.ts` into
  `scaffold-pipeline.ts` rather than reimplemented.

  Also fixes a silent-wrong-result path: `--template cf-team` previously fell
  through to scaffolding a `minimal` app. The run "succeeded" and the user found
  out later. Unknown, missing, and declared-but-unpublished template names now
  each fail with an explicit message that LISTS what is available, and exit 1.

  The catalogue distinguishes three states honestly — built-in, available from
  npm, and declared-but-not-yet-published (`vercel-team`, `fly-team`, `cf-solo`,
  `cf-full-agent` are in the registry but 404 on npm, and are shown as
  unselectable rather than offered or hidden).

- [#612](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/pull/612) [`9286182`](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/commit/9286182f38211a61344d46d9a38ef4821605bf93) Thanks [@srmcguirt](https://github.com/srmcguirt)! - Scaffold experience: agent tooling, honest per-build-target claims, teaching voice.

  Adds `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` (a one-line `@AGENTS.md` import, per Anthropic's
  guidance) and `.mcp.json` to scaffolded projects, gated behind
  `--no-agent-tooling` for users who want a clean tree. `.mcp.json` registers
  `npx aihu mcp serve` — the `@aihu/mcp` server exposing `aihu_validate`
  (compiles source, returns real diagnostics) and `aihu_example` (cookbook
  recipes), so an agent working in a scaffolded project can check its own work
  against the compiler instead of guessing at novel syntax.

  Previously only the cf-team template emitted any of this; the built-in
  templates shipped `.vscode/*` and nothing else.

  Also corrects what a static build claims about itself. The starter page said
  "These actions are exposed to AI agents as MCP tools" and linked an MCP server
  card — neither true for a client build, where `emit.rs`'s `elide_agent` strips
  agent metadata by design. It now distinguishes the declaration a static build
  genuinely publishes from the live, callable tools a server provides.

### Patch Changes

- [#613](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/pull/613) [`8aa12dc`](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/commit/8aa12dc1412125635880b09fe7b8f8a36fb6c7a4) Thanks [@srmcguirt](https://github.com/srmcguirt)! - Fix the agent template's typecheck failing again on a fresh scaffold.

  `bun run typecheck` — the command the template's own next-steps prints —
  failed with TS7006 on the websocket `message` handler's parameters. Contextual
  typing from `Bun.serve`'s handler map does not reach them, so under the
  scaffolded project's `strict` they are implicit-any.

  This is a regression, not a new bug: [#595](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/issues/595) fixed this class of error by adding
  `@types/bun` and `skipLibCheck`, and [#601](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/issues/601) reintroduced it while wiring the
  readiness surface into `server.ts`. Both websocket handler blocks in the
  generator are fixed, and the reasoning is recorded inline so the next edit to
  that file does not undo it a third time.

  Verified on a real npm scaffold outside the monorepo: `typecheck` exits 0 with
  zero implicit-any errors.

- [#599](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/pull/599) [`2dff3b5`](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/commit/2dff3b5df8d8cead0e14446e9c4bbbc0cbc9d747) Thanks [@srmcguirt](https://github.com/srmcguirt)! - Fix the agent template's own typecheck failing on a fresh scaffold.

  `npm create aihu --template agent` then `npm run typecheck` — the script the
  template emits, and the one its own next-steps output tells you to run —
  failed immediately with 12 errors:

  ```
  mcp.ts(72,1):     error TS2868: Cannot find name 'Bun'.
  server.ts(115,1): error TS2868: Cannot find name 'Bun'.
  mcp.ts(74,9):     error TS7006: Parameter 'req' implicitly has an 'any' type.
  ```

  The template emits `server.ts` and `mcp.ts` calling `Bun.serve()` while
  declaring `types: ['node']` with nothing providing Bun's globals. Under
  `strict: true` the missing namespace also made every callback parameter an
  implicit-any, so one missing dependency produced twelve errors.

  Adds `@types/bun` and `types: ['node', 'bun']`, plus `skipLibCheck` — required
  because `@types/bun` and vite declare `ImportMeta.hot` incompatibly (TS2430)
  with no user code involved.

  Verified on both package managers: typecheck and build exit 0.

- [#606](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/pull/606) [`c8c1d71`](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/commit/c8c1d714a9a221708ab6db3399c1e6e13d63f7ab) Thanks [@srmcguirt](https://github.com/srmcguirt)! - **Scaffold: `--css engine` no longer silently pins `shadowMode: 'shadow'` (FEL-425).**

  `create-aihu app --css engine` (and `aihu app --css engine`) emitted a plugin-global
  `css: { shadowMode: 'shadow' }` block even when the user never passed `--shadow` —
  fabricating a "choice" that outranks the DA4 page/layout light-DOM default and put
  the scaffolded page in shadow DOM, for exactly the scaffold that most needs global
  CSS to reach component internals.

  The shadow choice is now `ShadowChoice | undefined` end to end: the `css: { shadowMode }`
  block is written **only when the user explicitly chose** a mode (`--shadow light|shadow`
  or a deliberate wizard selection). With no choice, nothing is emitted and the framework
  defaults apply — pages and layouts light DOM, leaf components shadow DOM. A scaffold
  that pins the default freezes it.

  - `create-aihu app --css engine` → light-DOM page, utility CSS reaches the global cascade
  - `create-aihu app --css engine --shadow shadow` → still explicitly shadow (deliberate choice kept)
  - `create-aihu app --css engine --shadow light` → still explicitly light
  - The wizard's shadow-mode prompt gained a "default (framework defaults)" first option;
    pressing Enter is no longer treated as choosing `shadow`.
  - Invalid `--shadow` values are now ignored (framework defaults) instead of silently
    becoming `shadow`.

  Note: an explicit `--shadow` choice is still carried as the **project-wide** plugin
  config, so it also governs leaves and layouts (e.g. `--shadow light` flips leaves to
  light DOM too). That is the existing semantic of the flag; a per-file mechanism for
  the scaffolded page only would be a separate change.

- [#599](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/pull/599) [`2dff3b5`](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/commit/2dff3b5df8d8cead0e14446e9c4bbbc0cbc9d747) Thanks [@srmcguirt](https://github.com/srmcguirt)! - Resolve auto-installed templates from the invoking project, not the CLI's cache.

  `aihu app --template <pkg>` could not work for any user outside the monorepo,
  on any package manager:

  ```
  $ bunx @aihu/cli@latest app testapp --template cf-team --pm bun
  Installing template package @aihu/templates-cf-team...
  Resolved, downloaded and extracted [2]        <- install SUCCEEDED
  ERROR: Failed to install template package     <- resolution FAILED
  ```

  `autoInstallTemplate()` runs `<pm> add <pkg>` in `process.cwd()`, so the
  template lands in the user's project. `resolveTemplatePackagePath()` then used
  `import.meta.resolve()`, which resolves relative to the CLI module — and under
  `bunx`/`npx` that module lives in a package-manager cache with no view of the
  user's project. Install and resolve were looking in different places; the
  package was on disk the whole time.

  The existing fallback only searched `packages/templates/<short>`, which exists
  only inside the aihu monorepo — so the one environment where this worked was
  the one no user is in.

  Adds a first-choice strategy that checks `<cwd>/node_modules/<pkg>`.

### Major Changes

- [#479](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/pull/479) [`9dd7654`](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/commit/9dd7654678da1149705e21324f6b30e9baafcd4b) Thanks [@srmcguirt](https://github.com/srmcguirt)! - DA4 ([#437](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/issues/437)): the binary shadow API (`'light' | 'shadow'`) and light-DOM-by-default pages — one breaking change.

  **The API.** `ShadowMode` collapsed to a BINARY `'light' | 'shadow'`; the
  `'open'`, `'closed'`, and `'none'` tokens are retired everywhere (the
  `$shadow` macro, the plugin-global `shadowMode` config /
  `css: { shadowMode }`, the runtime `defineElement` options, and the CLI
  `--shadow` flag). `'shadow'` attaches an OPEN root internally — open is the
  only browser mode aihu's composition/hydration can use; `'closed'` was
  self-contradictory (a closed root nulls `this.shadowRoot`, so light-DOM
  detection misclassified it and content rendered into the host anyway).
  `'light'` attaches no root, so `this.shadowRoot === null` is an unambiguous
  detection. Migration: `'open'` → `'shadow'`, `'none'` → `'light'`,
  `'closed'` → `'shadow'`.

  **The defaults.** Page-level components — those with an `@route` block — and
  layout SFCs (files under the configured layouts dir, default `src/layouts/`)
  now default to `'light'`, so server-rendered page content is reachable by
  crawlers and agents that do not execute JavaScript. Leaf components (no
  `@route`) default to `'shadow'` (behaviorally the old `'open'` default).

  Precedence, in order: a per-file `$shadow` pin > an explicit plugin-global
  `shadowMode` config > the page/layout default `'light'` > the leaf default
  `'shadow'`. An unpinned page carries a new `// @aihu:shadow-default light`
  marker (distinct from the `$shadow` pin marker) so the implicit default ranks
  below an explicit plugin-global config.

  Breaking implications:

  - Retired tokens fail loudly: `$shadow` with an old token is a C471 compile
    error; `css.shadowMode` with one throws at config validation; `--shadow`
    with one warns and falls back to the default.
  - A `$shadow`-less `@route` page's `@style` block now joins the global
    cascade instead of being trapped in a shadow root — scope bare element
    selectors under a page root class (see the migration guide §8).
  - W472 (the phase-1 advisory that announced this flip) is retired.
  - The static-island fast path is skipped for light-DOM components — the shim
    cannot honor `shadowMode: 'light'`; such components keep the full runtime
    path.
  - css-engine scaffolds now always emit an explicit `css: { shadowMode }`
    block carrying the wizard's `--shadow` choice (default `'shadow'`), since
    the page default would otherwise override it.

### Minor Changes

- [#489](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/pull/489) [`80531dc`](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/commit/80531dcc4dfc43bc9cd399bbb8ab4520efb8f15a) Thanks [@srmcguirt](https://github.com/srmcguirt)! - Template grammar v2 — the prefix-less template (founder-ratified 40-spec).

  One rule: naked keywords + naked HTML attributes + naked framework vocabulary;
  `{expr}` braces mean expression, quoted strings mean static; `$` retreats to
  `@state` macros only.

  **New grammar:** `if={…}`/`elseif={…}`/`else` attribute chains (adjacency-checked),
  the item-first `each={item, i of items}` `of`-binder with destructuring, `key={…}`,
  `empty` siblings, colon directives `on:<event>` (with `.prevent`/`.stop`/`.self`/`.once`
  modifiers), `bind:<prop>`, `class:<name>`, the `attr:<name>` literal escape hatch,
  naked `show`/`html`/`ref`/`once`/`memo`/`raw`, the NEW `<group>` fragment carrier,
  naked framework elements (`<slot>` is now THE projection form), and the enhanced
  `<a>` (SPA navigation, `prefetch`, `replace`, `aria-current`, auto-opt-out +
  explicit `reload`) replacing `<$link>`.

  **Retired (compile errors with fix hints):** `{#if}` C601, `{#each}` C602,
  `{@html}` C603, `{{ident}}` C604, `<$if>`/`<$else>` C605, `$if=`/`$each=`/`$let=`
  C606, every other `$`-attribute C607, `<$link>` C608, other `<$…>` elements C609,
  adjacency violations C610, unknown non-hyphenated elements C611. New lints:
  W601 (keyless stateful `each`), W602 (non-empty string on a boolean attribute).

  **Intended emission diffs:** internal `<a href>` links now lower to
  `createLinkBoundary` (the retired `<$link>` lowering) with a runtime
  origin/scheme auto-opt-out; everything else lowers through the same arbor
  structural calls as v1 (`when`/`each`/fragment branches).

  `aihu migrate --v2` now lands on this grammar (new final codemod pass:
  `compiler/js/codemods/template-grammar-v2`).

  ([#502](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/issues/502), [#503](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/issues/503), [#504](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/issues/504)).

  - `aihu migrate` (macro-simplification): consume a multi-line `import { … }`
    as a single statement so its members are no longer orphaned below the
    closing brace and single-line imports are no longer hoisted into the open
    brace (the import-scrambling defect).
  - `aihu migrate --state` (state-wrapper): de-call prop reads (`name()` →
    `name`) after `$prop` → `prop()`, since `prop()` returns a value in the
    wrapper model rather than a callable signal.
  - `aihu migrate --v2` (template-grammar): accept the dot spelling
    `$class.modifier` in addition to `$class:modifier`.
  - Type-check sidecar: `__aihu_each` over an `any` iterable now types loop
    bindings as `any` instead of `unknown` (one conditional-typed generic with
    an IsAny guard).
  - `aihu-tsc`: surface the first real compile error when a file cannot be
    compiled (a stale-compiler error immediately reveals a version mismatch),
    and document version-aligning `@aihu/tsc` with `@aihu/compiler`.

## 0.8.3

### Patch Changes

- [#395](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/pull/395) [`8127925`](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/commit/8127925482725c8394c03298a27b91cbbfc59418) Thanks [@srmcguirt](https://github.com/srmcguirt)! - **`.aihu` files are now type-checked.** They were not before — at all.

  The type-check sidecar declared every template-referenced binding as an `any`
  parameter and never emitted the `@state` body, so TypeScript was handed a file
  that could not disagree with the author about anything. A `const x: number =
'a string'` inside `@state`, or a typo'd property, passed `tsc --noEmit` clean.
  The green check was over code TypeScript had never seen.

  Two things change:

  **`@aihu/compiler`** now inlines the `@state` body into the type-check surface, at
  its real source lines. Bindings carry their true types instead of `any`, imports
  resolve so call sites are checked, and a diagnostic inside `@state` cites the
  `.aihu` line the author wrote it on. Only loop aliases remain `any` — `{#each xs
as m}` binds `m` in the template, so there is no declaration to borrow a type
  from.

  **`@aihu/tsc`** (new) provides `aihu-tsc`, which projects each `.aihu` into the
  TypeScript program as a VIRTUAL file via Volar's `proxyCreateProgram`. No
  `.aihu.ts` sidecar is written to disk any more: the Vite plugin no longer emits
  them, and consumers can delete the ones they have and drop `*.aihu.ts` from
  `.gitignore`.

  **Migration.** Replace `tsc --noEmit` with `aihu-tsc` in your `typecheck` script
  (`@aihu/cli` now scaffolds this for new projects). Plain `tsc` cannot see inside a
  `.aihu` file, so it will keep reporting a clean pass over every SFC in your
  project without having checked one.

  Expect real diagnostics the first time you run it — this is code that has never
  been type-checked. Implicit-`any` inside `.aihu` files is suppressed by default,
  since no corpus has ever been annotated for it; `aihu-tsc --strict-templates`
  turns it on.

  The scaffolded `<task-list>` now hydrates its signals from `localStorage` on
  mount and writes back on every change, so the durable component **survives a
  page refresh** out of the box. Because the agent's bridge calls drive the same
  signals, an agent's reskin (label, variant, tasks) persists too. Browser-only
  and guarded, so build/SSR safely fall back to defaults. (For state shared across
  tabs/devices, move the source of truth server-side — e.g. a Durable Object / KV
  behind the agent gate.)

### Patch Changes

- [#376](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/pull/376) [`d48a7ad`](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/commit/d48a7ad12851ee30b869ee5f8f234038d97c9aff) Thanks [@srmcguirt](https://github.com/srmcguirt)! - fix(cli): agent template (`create-aihu --template agent`) now mounts

  The scaffolded `<task-list>` never registered as a custom element, so the page
  rendered blank. Two bugs in the `agent` template's `task-list.aihu`:

  - The reskin signal setters were named `setLabel`/`setVariant` — colliding with
    the `setLabel`/`setVariant` `$action`s, so the compiler emitted two top-level
    `const setLabel`/`const setVariant`. The dev transpile the vite plugin runs
    failed on the duplicate symbol, the plugin silently fell back to serving raw
    TS, and the element never defined. Renamed the setters to
    `writeLabel`/`writeVariant`.
  - `$class={['tl', variant]}` passed the signal _accessor_ (a function) into the
    class array, which the class helper drops as a non-string — so the agent's
    `setVariant` had no visible effect. The signal is now called:
    `$class={['tl', variant()]}`.

  Adds a `scaffold-compile-clean` regression guard that transpiles the agent
  template's compiled client output (the exact dev path) and fails on this bug
  class — the native compiler exits 0 on the duplicate `const`, so file-presence
  and native-compile checks alone passed it silently.

  - **New opt-in `agent` template** (`create-aihu --template agent`, or option 4 in the
    wizard): the headline aihu thesis made runnable. A durable on-screen `<task-list>`
    Web Component that BOTH a human and an external AI agent drive — the agent reaches the
    same visible instance over `@aihu/agent-server`'s capability bridge (server = policy
    gate, browser = sole executor). Two-process app (Bun bridge server + Vite, client-target
    compiler). Verified end-to-end: typing in the input AND an external
    `curl /agent/call` both append to the same live instance; unexposed actions are rejected.
  - **`@aihu/agent-server` first publish** (added to the release allowlist). Includes the
    fix that lets `createAgentServer`'s `node` mount path stand up its own server-side DOM
    internally (no consumer jsdom/`createHost` glue) when the runtime has no `document`.

  The bridge in the template is unauthenticated (local dev/demo); the generated server
  warns against exposing it to untrusted networks.

  - **`bun run dev` no longer crashes.** The generated `vite.config.ts` now sets
    `optimizeDeps: { exclude: ['@aihu/app'] }` — esbuild's dep pre-bundle can't
    resolve the `virtual:aihu-routes` / `virtual:aihu-layouts` modules that
    `@aihu/app`'s client entry imports (the router plugin resolves them at request
    time), so excluding `@aihu/app` from pre-bundling is required for dev to boot.
  - **The default scaffold now delivers the agentic surface.** `vite.config.ts`
    wires `viteAgentReadinessIntegration` (imported directly from
    `@aihu-plugin/agent-readiness`, now a scaffolded devDependency), so
    `vite build` emits `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`, `robots.txt`, the MCP server
    card at `/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json`, and JSON-LD — all served in
    `vite dev` too. The hello-world page is now an agent-callable component: its
    counter exposes `increment` / `reset` as `$action` tools, mirrored into the
    card's `skills`. (A live, callable MCP endpoint still requires running
    `@aihu/server`; the static card is discovery metadata — noted in the config.)

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- [#368](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/pull/368) [`e237cf3`](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/commit/e237cf3820180e2e98807af0dbc253eeb9afa2e0) Thanks [@srmcguirt](https://github.com/srmcguirt)! - fix create-aihu / `bun create aihu` public-release blockers

  - **P0 — scaffolded apps now declare `trustedDependencies: ["@aihu/compiler"]`.**
    Without it, `bun install` blocks `@aihu/compiler`'s postinstall (the step
    that arch-validates and downloads the correct native binary), so the
    wrong-arch binary baked into the published tarball stayed in place and
    `bun run build` failed with `ENOEXEC` (`Unknown system error -8`) on
    macOS/Windows. `npm install` was unaffected (npm runs postinstall by
    default); the break was bun-specific — and bun is the flagship path.
  - **Non-interactive / pipe-safe scaffolding.** New flags `--template`,
    `--pm`, `--yes` / `-y`, `--no-git`. When `--yes` is passed or stdin is not a
    TTY, the wizard runs fully non-interactively with documented defaults. This
    fixes the prior behavior where piped input silently created nothing and
    exited 0 (Node `readline.question` losing buffered lines at EOF), and
    unblocks CI/scripted use.
  - **Template selection now actually differentiates output.** `minimal`,
    `full`, and `docs` previously produced byte-identical scaffolds;
    `scaffoldApp` now honors the choice (`full` adds a default layout + a second
    page; `docs` ships a docs-flavored landing + guide page). Every variant
    scaffold → install → build is verified on both bun and npm.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [#276](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/pull/276) [`22234fa`](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/commit/22234fa1d34e913d84bcdbcc9c2bcf1fb315186b) Thanks [@srmcguirt](https://github.com/srmcguirt)! - Scaffold `@aihu/css-engine` out of the box, with a shadow-mode choice.

  `aihu app <name>` gains two flags on the legacy scaffold path:

  - `--css <engine|none>` (with `--css-engine` as a boolean alias for
    `--css engine`) — includes `@aihu/css-engine` in `dependencies` and emits a
    utility-class starter page (`flex gap-4 max-w-7xl mx-auto p-8`, `text-3xl
font-bold`, …) instead of the hand-written `@style` starter.
  - `--shadow <open|closed|none>` — the shadow mode threaded into the compiler
    when css-engine is on (default `open`). `--shadow` without `--css engine`
    warns and is ignored.

  The `create-aihu` interactive wizard asks the same two questions. The default
  css-engine mode is `open` (scoped shadow fold), which is the compiler default —
  so the default css-engine scaffold writes **no** `css` block; only
  `closed`/`none` emit an explicit `css: { shadowMode }`. The plain (no-flag)
  scaffold output is unchanged.

  `@aihu/app` patch: corrected the `CssConfig` JSDoc — `@aihu/css-engine` is
  scoped by design and works in any shadow mode (its utilities fold into each
  component's shadow style); `shadowMode: 'none'` is only needed for
  global-cascade frameworks (Tailwind/UnoCSS/Pico) or to style light-DOM /
  external (slotted) children. (Wording only; no type or validation change.)

- [#255](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/pull/255) [`af25c7c`](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/commit/af25c7cfa47d29112e4f8a017b59a0432031a32d) Thanks [@srmcguirt](https://github.com/srmcguirt)! - Surface the `--template=cf-team` option in `aihu app` usage text and clarify in `llms-full.txt` that the no-flag `aihu app <name>` is a client-only Vite + router SPA while `--template=cf-team` scaffolds the deployable Cloudflare monorepo (workspaces, wrangler, auth, agent surface).

  Docs-only patch. The underlying scaffolder fix already shipped in `@aihu/cli@0.5.2` (PR [#247](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/issues/247)); this addresses follow-up discoverability friction reported by users who expected an SPA-first scaffold and weren't aware of the `--template` flag.

## 0.5.2

### Patch Changes

- [#249](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/pull/249) [`6ed33f8`](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/commit/6ed33f80bfdf193382e9fb1d192c0c1d4e6ef069) Thanks [@srmcguirt](https://github.com/srmcguirt)! - Default `bunx @aihu/cli app NAME` scaffold switches from rolldown to Vite + `viteAihuPlugin()`. The prior rolldown output was not runnable end-to-end — `createApp()` from `@aihu/app/client` imports `virtual:aihu-routes`, a Vite-plugin virtual module with no rolldown equivalent, so `bun run dev` produced an app that could not route. Mirrors `examples/blog-router`; matches the direction `apps/docs` already moved.

  Also: `index.html` now uses `<div id="outlet">` + `./src/main.ts` (matches `createApp()`'s default mount target — the prior `<demo-root>` custom element threw on boot); `@aihu/router` is now an explicit runtime dependency; the dead `commands/app.ts` divergent Vite scaffold and the unreachable `appRolldownConfig` / `appViteConfig` back-compat alias have been removed.

  Marked as `patch` rather than `minor`: the user-facing contract (`aihu app` command) is functionally additive (it now produces a runnable project instead of a broken one), and the removed JS exports (`appRolldownConfig`, `appViteConfig`) are not depended on by any in-repo consumer. Patch avoids cascading a major bump onto `@aihu/templates-cf-team`'s `^0.5.1` peer range.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- [#203](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/pull/203) [`a6f9b53`](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/commit/a6f9b536620115e0e3bed8551c165d4634aed7f8) Thanks [@srmcguirt](https://github.com/srmcguirt)! - fix(cli-templates): bring all scaffolder grammar to v1 (compiler@0.4.0) so a freshly scaffolded project compiles clean

  Every scaffold path previously emitted stale grammar that the v1 compiler rejects, so each new aihu project started broken:

  - `create-aihu` / `aihu app` (`packages/cli/src/index.ts`): `$on:click={…}` (C305) → `$on.click={…}`; `{{ count }}` → `{count}`.
  - `aihu app` legacy + `APP_INDEX_SCRIBE` (`commands/app.ts`, `templates/app.ts`): bare `$prop name: T = d` → collection-form `$prop: { name: { default, type } }`; `{{ name }}` → `{name}`.
  - `aihu component` (`index.ts`): comment-only `<div>` body ("expected tag name") → a real heading element.
  - `@aihu/templates-cf-team` (`live-counter.aihu`, `expose.aihu`, `app.aihu`): bare `@state` entries → collection-form `$prop`/`$action`; removed `@agent { $expose / $describe }` (C440) → per-entry `expose:` / `describe:` on `@state` macros (the v2 agent surface); `{{ … }}` → `{ … }`.

  Adds a scaffold-AND-compile guard (`scaffold-compile-clean.test.ts`) that scaffolds every path and runs the current `aihu-compile` on each emitted `.aihu`, asserting zero compile errors — the regression class the prior file-presence harness silently passed.

### Minor Changes

- [#196](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/pull/196) [`faca280`](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/commit/faca2804cf62c05ffc90ef867faa2058b5e267ad) Thanks [@srmcguirt](https://github.com/srmcguirt)! - Wire up the `aihu migrate <files...>` command. The v0→v1 grammar codemod was
  fully implemented but never registered in the CLI entrypoint; it is now
  available and listed in `aihu --help`, which makes the `C304`/`C305`/`C306`
  compiler errors' "Run: npx aihu migrate" guidance accurate. Fixes upstream
  Bug 9c.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#171](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/pull/171) [`7577bd1`](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/commit/7577bd10f391b9f3996048371706c9be34b08e2e) Thanks [@srmcguirt](https://github.com/srmcguirt)! - v1.0.9 — Naming Scheme A: rename `@aihu/data` → `@aihu-plugin/data` and
  `@aihu/agent-readiness` → `@aihu-plugin/agent-readiness`.

  The two plugin-contract packages move from the framework-core `@aihu/*`
  scope into the new `@aihu-plugin/*` scope so that plugin-contract and
  framework-core surfaces can evolve at independent cadences. Decision
  record `6c7aa75b-...` (Amendment 04) ratified the scope on 2026-05-09 and
  v1.0.9 §400-416 of the v1 framework plan covers the cutover mechanics.

  **Per-package effect**

  - `@aihu-plugin/data` (new) — first publish at `1.0.0`. Same public API as
    `@aihu/data@0.1.0`; only the npm name changed.
  - `@aihu-plugin/agent-readiness` (new) — first publish at `1.0.0`. Same
    public API as `@aihu/agent-readiness@0.1.1`; only the npm name changed.
  - `@aihu/data@1.0.0` — published as a **moved stub**. The legacy name now
    installs a tiny package that re-exports `@aihu-plugin/data`. Carries
    `"deprecated"` metadata so npm surfaces the move on `npm install`.
  - `@aihu/agent-readiness@1.0.0` — same moved-stub treatment.
  - `@aihu/cli` — extends `aihu migrate` with a v1.0.9 pass that rewrites
    package.json `dependencies` blocks, static imports, dynamic imports, and
    JSDoc / Markdown URL references. Idempotent on already-renamed input.

  **Migration**

  Existing installs keep working via the deprecated stubs. To upgrade:

  ```sh
  bun add @aihu-plugin/data @aihu-plugin/agent-readiness
  bun remove @aihu/data @aihu/agent-readiness
  bunx aihu migrate
  ```

  `@aihu/agent-service` is explicitly **out of scope** for this rename and
  stays under the framework-core `@aihu/*` scope.

  character was double-encoded somewhere in the original write; npm shows the
  mangled string on the package page. Doc-only.

  (This bump also serves as the verification release for npm OIDC trusted
  publishing — the previous smoke shipped before `NPM_PROVENANCE=1` was in repo
  variables, so its tarball lacks attestations.)

  - `rolldown.config.ts`: quote the input key so kebab-case app names (`my-app`)
    don't produce a JS parse error. Was emitting `input: { my-app: 'src/main.ts' }`
    which fails at config load with "Expected , or } but found -".
  - `rolldown.config.ts`: import `aihuCompilerPlugin` from `@aihu/compiler` (the
    package's main export) instead of `@aihu/compiler/plugin` — the latter
    subpath doesn't exist in the published `exports` map.

  After this release, `bunx @aihu/cli app <name>` followed by `bun install` and
  `bun run build` succeeds end-to-end against fresh npm.

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- [#153](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/pull/153) [`f2421b1`](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/commit/f2421b17a534d518c4f21c22d7f5e47a45c030da) Thanks [@srmcguirt](https://github.com/srmcguirt)! - Scaffold install path fixes.

  `@aihu/cli`:

  - `aihu app <name>` now emits `package.json` with `latest` ranges for all `@aihu/*` deps instead of the aspirational `^1.0.0` (no 1.x exists on npm; the old pins broke `bun install` immediately).
  - Adds the missing `@aihu/app` (used by `src/main.ts`) and `@aihu/compiler` (used by `rolldown.config.ts`) to the generated dependency list.
  - Drops the malformed `bun@1` `packageManager` fallback — detects bun via `globalThis.Bun?.version`, omits the field when no real version is detectable.
  - Generates `.vscode/extensions.json` (recommends `fellwork.vscode-aihu`) and `.vscode/settings.json` (file association for `.aihu`) so new adopters get language support out of the box.

  `@aihu/router`, `@aihu/app`:

  - Republish so transitive pins point at clean versions. Previously `@aihu/router@0.1.1` pinned `@aihu/server@0.1.0` (carries the `workspace:*` leak) and `@aihu/app@0.1.4` peer-pinned `@aihu/router@0.1.0` (also leaked). Combined effect: `bun install` of any scaffolded app failed at the workspace-protocol resolution step. Both republish with deps targeting the post-leak versions.

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- [#150](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/pull/150) [`4ad09a4`](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/commit/4ad09a4369bebaf6dffa49dfd726383651f06c0b) Thanks [@srmcguirt](https://github.com/srmcguirt)! - Re-publish `@aihu/cli` without the broken `@aihu/mcp` workspace dependency.

  `@aihu/cli@0.3.1` shipped with `"@aihu/mcp": "workspace:*"` in its published
  manifest. The `workspace:*` protocol is monorepo-internal — outside the workspace
  it cannot resolve, so `bunx @aihu/cli ...` failed at install time with:

  ```
  error: Workspace dependency "@aihu/mcp" not found
  error: @aihu/mcp@workspace:* failed to resolve
  ```

  If you hit this on 0.3.1, pin to the previous good version as a workaround:

  ```
  bunx @aihu/cli@0.3.0 app my-app
  ```

  0.3.2 ships from a clean manifest (no `@aihu/mcp` runtime dep) and the release
  pipeline now publishes via `scripts/publish-all.sh`, which runs `bun publish`
  per-package. `bun publish` rewrites `workspace:*` to a real version range at
  pack time, so the protocol cannot leak into a published artifact again.

  0.3.1 has been deprecated on npm.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#86](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/pull/86) [`86af1be`](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/commit/86af1beb2b34cd0dc270fdd9ad8ba1de4d19de90) Thanks [@srmcguirt](https://github.com/srmcguirt)! - Adds the `@aihu/templates-*` family as a separate package family (per arch-6 §13 Q2 RESOLVED). `@aihu/cli` ships the template-manifest contract, scaffold pipeline, conditional-eval evaluator, hand-rolled prompts library, and `KNOWN_TEMPLATES` baked registry. `@aihu/templates-cf-team` is the first published template — Cloudflare Workers + bun workspaces + moon + better-auth (default) | kinde | supabase. Backward-compatible: `aihu app foo` (no flags) produces byte-identical output to today.

### Patch Changes

- [#94](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/pull/94) [`8e258e7`](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/commit/8e258e7b12fbb1ad1a1942d42606fc889dc94f25) Thanks [@srmcguirt](https://github.com/srmcguirt)! - Fix `bunx @aihu/cli --template cf-team` on Windows (Node.js runtime path).

  `bunx` resolves the `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang and runs the CLI under Node.js,
  which cannot dynamically import `.ts` files. `loadTemplateConfig` was silently
  swallowing the import error and throwing a misleading "file not found" message even
  when `template.config.ts` was present on disk.

  - `@aihu/templates-cf-team`: ship compiled `template.config.js` alongside the
    TypeScript source so Node.js falls back to the JS module. Bun still prefers `.ts`.
  - `@aihu/cli`: surface the last import error in the `loadTemplateConfig` throw
    message so future failures are immediately diagnosable.
