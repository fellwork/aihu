//! swarm-bus — Rust reimplementation of the portable core of `~/.swarm/bus.py`.
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS
//!   bus.py is the ORACLE: a thin Python CLI over one SQLite file
//!   (`~/.swarm/bus.db`, overridable via `SWARM_DB`) that lets swarm agents
//!   broadcast/pull messages and negotiate work via CONTRACTs (offer → claim
//!   → verdict → reconciled status). This crate is a drop-in, compiled
//!   reimplementation against the *same* schema and the *same* exit-code
//!   contract: an empty result must never read like a broken query.
//!
//! EXIT CODES (matches the oracle)
//!   0  = ok (including a successful non-empty `pull`/`watch`)
//!   2  = broken input: missing/unknown role, missing required field, no
//!        such contract, a verdict with no --contract, a blocked with no
//!        --question, a verdict reporting --status done with no (or
//!        malformed) --claims, or an unknown --status value
//!   3  = genuinely empty (a `pull`/`watch` with nothing new — NOT an error)
//!   4  = conflict (claiming a contract someone else already owns)
//!   5  = IDENTITY MISMATCH (bound_identity: role is registered to a
//!        different workspace than the one this process is running in)
//!   64 = unknown command / no command given
//!   1  = unexpected internal error (DB I/O etc.) — the oracle has no
//!        distinct code for this either; an uncaught Python exception also
//!        exits 1.
//!
//! FULL COMMAND SURFACE (parity with bus.py)
//!   send offer claim ack attempt setstatus pull watch ready sync link
//!   verify-merged
//!   (`status`, the oracle's pretty-printed contract table, is intentionally
//!   not reproduced here — it's a human dashboard, not a coordination
//!   primitive, and every field it prints is already reachable via `pull`/
//!   direct DB read. Nothing in the brief asked for it. `link` and
//!   `verify-merged` have no oracle counterpart at all — they exist solely
//!   for this crate's Linear/GitHub accountability sync; see ACCOUNTABILITY
//!   SYNC below.)
//!
//! TYPED PAYLOADS (docs/typed-bus-payloads.md, agent-swarm@design/typed-bus-payloads)
//!   The actionable parts of a message are validated FIELDS, not prose to be
//!   regexed downstream by a consumer. Concretely:
//!     - `msg.contract` (already existed) — a `verdict` MUST set it; rejected
//!       at the boundary (exit 2) if absent, never silently accepted.
//!     - `msg.pr` (new, nullable INTEGER) / `msg.claims` (new, nullable TEXT,
//!       "verb:target,verb:target") — optional structured fields on `send`.
//!     - a `blocked` MUST set `--question` (exit 2 if absent) — the one
//!       thing a human must decide, not buried in `body`.
//!     - `contract.needs` (new, nullable TEXT, comma-separated contract ids)
//!       — the Graph/DAG edge. `ready --id C` reports whether every upstream
//!       need has reached a satisfied status.
//!     - `msg.vstatus` (new, nullable TEXT, one of `done`/`blocked`/
//!       `could-not-check`) — set via `send --status <value>`, mirroring the
//!       Verdict schema in the design doc. This is the FIELD, not prose,
//!       that answers "does this verdict report completion?" — the
//!       reconciler classifies a contract by checking a done-verdict's
//!       --claims against the agent's transcript, so a verdict that reports
//!       completion with nothing to check against is the same silent-failure
//!       class as a verdict with no --contract:
//!         - `--kind verdict --status done` (the default when `--status` is
//!           omitted, so pre-existing done-verdicts are still caught)
//!           REQUIRES a non-empty, well-formed `--claims` — rejected (exit 2)
//!           if absent.
//!         - `--kind verdict --status blocked` / `--status could-not-check`
//!           does NOT require `--claims` — there is legitimately nothing to
//!           claim.
//!         - an unknown `--status` value is rejected (exit 2), listing the
//!           three valid values.
//!     - `msg.claims` is VALIDATED, not merely required non-empty: it is a
//!       comma-separated list of `verb:target` pairs, where `verb` is one of
//!       `filed`, `pushed`, `merged`, `committed`, `ran`, `opened`, `closed`.
//!       An entry with no `:`, an unknown verb, or an empty target is
//!       rejected (exit 2) naming the offending entry — an unparseable claim
//!       is the same silent-failure class as no claim at all, so it is
//!       caught at the boundary rather than stored and discovered later.
//!
//! ACCOUNTABILITY SYNC (docs/typed-bus-payloads.md, "Accountability" section,
//! contract C-SWARM-SYNC) — binds the contract lifecycle to Linear + GitHub.
//! LINEAR IS THE PRIMARY TRACKER; GitHub issues are a MIRRORED SECONDARY
//! surface — the public one, not the source of truth. `contract` gains three
//! nullable columns: `linear` (a Linear identifier, e.g. "FEL-440"),
//! `github_issue`, `github_pr` (integers).
//!
//!   sync --pull                 reads Linear/GitHub, but DOES write locally
//!                                in two passes. (1) PULL: the real backlog
//!                                comes IN as candidate contracts — open
//!                                Linear FEL issues (state not Done/Canceled)
//!                                and open GitHub issues labelled `swarm`
//!                                each become a `status='offered',
//!                                owner=NULL` contract row carrying its
//!                                external id. Idempotent — matched and
//!                                deduped on the external id (`linear` /
//!                                `github_issue`), never re-inserted. NEVER
//!                                auto-assigns an owner — same rule as
//!                                onboarding: a pulled ticket carries no
//!                                role. (2) NORMALIZE: because Linear is
//!                                primary, no contract may permanently carry
//!                                only a GitHub-side id — every contract with
//!                                `github_issue` set and `linear` still NULL
//!                                gets a Linear task CREATED for it on team
//!                                FEL (title = the GitHub issue's title,
//!                                description points back at the GitHub
//!                                issue), the contract keeps BOTH ids (never
//!                                renamed), and the GitHub issue gets a
//!                                one-time marker comment naming the new
//!                                Linear identifier. Idempotent — a contract
//!                                with both ids is never selected again, so a
//!                                converged backlog re-normalizes 0. A failed
//!                                per-contract create/link prints
//!                                `could-not-sync` and the command still
//!                                exits nonzero, same posture as everywhere
//!                                else in sync.
//!   sync --push [--confirm]     mirrors contract state OUT. Defaults to a
//!                                DRY RUN: prints the plan computed purely
//!                                from local DB state and performs zero
//!                                network calls. `--confirm` is required to
//!                                perform any real read or write. THE
//!                                LOAD-BEARING RULE: external "Done" mirrors
//!                                `status == verified` ONLY — `submitted` (an
//!                                agent's own claim) never produces a Done
//!                                transition; that gate is structural (see
//!                                `classify`), not a flag checked at the last
//!                                moment. DISPUTED/unverified stay In
//!                                Progress and get a comment explaining why —
//!                                and if the contract's GitHub issue is
//!                                already CLOSED at that moment (e.g. a
//!                                DISPUTED verdict arriving after an earlier
//!                                `verified` had closed it), it is REOPENED
//!                                first, before the comment: a disputed
//!                                contract must not leave its public issue
//!                                looking resolved. Symmetric with the
//!                                Verified arm's close — logged as
//!                                `"reopened"` only when a reopen actually
//!                                happened. Every write is idempotent (a
//!                                marker HTML comment is checked before
//!                                posting; a state mutation is skipped if
//!                                already at target) and logged to the new
//!                                `activity` table so the mirror itself is
//!                                auditable. A failed per-contract sync
//!                                prints `could-not-sync` and the whole
//!                                command exits nonzero — it never assumes
//!                                success.
//!   verify-merged [--confirm]   closes the swarm's last accountability
//!                                gap: a MERGED pull request is the
//!                                strongest evidence a contract's work is
//!                                real (it passed CI and the three-clause
//!                                merge gate), yet merging one advances
//!                                NOTHING today — a contract sits at
//!                                claimed/building/submitted/no-claims
//!                                forever while the code is already on main
//!                                and the tracking issue stays open. For
//!                                every such contract (never one already
//!                                `verified` — the selecting query excludes
//!                                it), resolve a PR number in priority
//!                                order: (a) contract.github_pr, (b) the
//!                                typed `pr` column on the contract's most
//!                                recent verdict message, (c) a STRICT
//!                                prose parse of that verdict's body
//!                                (`parse_pr_ref` — only a full GitHub pull
//!                                URL or `PR #N` / `PR#N`; a bare `#N` is
//!                                NEVER a PR reference, on purpose — see
//!                                that function's doc comment). No PR
//!                                anywhere in that chain -> skip, reported
//!                                explicitly (`no PR reference — skipped`),
//!                                never guessed. Checked via `gh pr view
//!                                --json state,mergedAt,mergeCommit`: MERGED
//!                                with a non-null `mergedAt` is the ONLY
//!                                accepted evidence (`is_merged_evidence`) —
//!                                an open or closed-unmerged PR proves
//!                                nothing. On merged evidence the contract
//!                                is written through `write_contract_status`
//!                                — the SAME internal path `setstatus
//!                                --reconciled` uses, because this command
//!                                IS a reconcile pass, just gated by an
//!                                objective external fact instead of a
//!                                human's judgment call — and that shared
//!                                path is exactly what lets the existing
//!                                `sync --push` go on to mirror the
//!                                resulting `verified` status out to
//!                                Linear/GitHub as Done, which in turn
//!                                closes the GitHub issue. DRY RUN BY
//!                                DEFAULT, exactly like `sync --push`:
//!                                without --confirm this still performs the
//!                                `gh pr view` reads (so the printed plan
//!                                reflects real GitHub state) but writes
//!                                NOTHING locally; `--confirm` performs the
//!                                writes. A `gh` failure for one contract
//!                                prints `could-not-check: <id> <reason>`
//!                                and the loop continues to the next
//!                                contract — a failed query is NEVER treated
//!                                as "not merged". Idempotent: an
//!                                already-`verified` contract is excluded
//!                                by the selecting query, so re-running
//!                                writes nothing new.
//!   link --id C-X [--github-issue N] [--linear FEL-N]
//!                                manual, LOCAL-ONLY linkage for a human who
//!                                has recognized a contract and a pre-
//!                                existing Linear/GitHub item as the same
//!                                twin — no network calls. COALESCE
//!                                semantics: never overwrites a non-null
//!                                linkage. A field already set to a
//!                                DIFFERENT value dies (exit 2) naming both,
//!                                rather than silently picking one. A value
//!                                already claimed by ANOTHER contract dies
//!                                CONFLICT (exit 4) naming that contract —
//!                                one external issue, one owning contract.
//!
//! SECURITY (non-negotiable): the Linear API key lives ONLY in the macOS
//! keychain (`security find-generic-password -s LINEAR_API_KEY -w`), read at
//! call time. It is never printed, never logged, never written to a file,
//! and never appears in any child process's argv (so it is invisible to
//! `ps`). It reaches `curl` exclusively via that one child process's
//! environment — curl's own `--variable %LINEAR_API_KEY` / `--expand-header`
//! feature (curl >= 8.3) reads and substitutes it internally; this program
//! never assembles the header string itself. GitHub calls shell out to `gh`,
//! which manages its own separate, already-authenticated credential store —
//! this code never touches a GitHub token at all.
//!
//! DIVERGENCES FROM THE ORACLE (deliberate, logged per the brief)
//!   1. `offer` here does NOT require `--brief`. The oracle's cmd_offer
//!      requires issue/surface/must-pass/must-fail/brief/to; the spec this
//!      crate was built against only requires issue/to/surface/must-pass/
//!      must-fail. `--brief` is accepted and folded into the dispatched
//!      message body when present; omitted otherwise. Flagged explicitly —
//!      do not read this as full oracle parity on `offer`.
//!   2. `offer`'s `--to` is, exactly as in the oracle, only checked for
//!      *presence*, not validated against the known-role set (the oracle's
//!      cmd_offer never calls need_role on `to`). Reproduced faithfully,
//!      not accidentally.
//!   3. A `blocked` message here is only required to carry `--question`
//!      (per this crate's brief). The typed-payload design doc's `Blocked`
//!      Zod schema also makes `contract` required on a blocked payload;
//!      that extra constraint is NOT enforced here because it is outside
//!      this crate's stated acceptance surface and would silently reject
//!      pre-existing `--kind blocked` traffic that never set `--contract`.
//!      Logged, not silently dropped.
//!   4. `watch`'s timestamp column is formatted in UTC, not the oracle's
//!      `time.localtime`. Reproducing local-timezone formatting would pull
//!      in a chrono/time dependency for a cosmetic column; the ordering and
//!      content of every row are otherwise identical. If wall-clock-local
//!      display ever matters to a consumer, that's the moment to add the
//!      dependency — not preemptively.
//!   5. `status` (the oracle's pretty-printed contract table) is not
//!      implemented — see FULL COMMAND SURFACE above.

// The Linear label `agent:<role>@<city>` carries the swarm's identity tuple —
// the same (workspace, role) the bus enforces at exit 5 — as FILTERABLE
// metadata: "everything builder@almaty owns" is a board filter, not an
// archaeology dig through comment bodies. The unique identifier is the AGENT
// IDENTITY, deliberately not the contract id: identity labels are a closed
// set bounded by the registry, per-contract labels would grow forever. The
// contract id keeps living in the marker comment and the `linear` column.
//
// Honest limit unchanged (FEL-436): the label is applied by the one shared
// credential, so it is checkable, not cryptographic. This upgrades
// attribution from buried to queryable — no further.
