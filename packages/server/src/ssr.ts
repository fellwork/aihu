/**
 * CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
 * 1. Zero client runtime imports. Zero DOM globals (no window, document, HTMLElement).
 *    ONE EXCEPTION, added deliberately: `@aihu/runtime/ssr`. That is not the
 *    client runtime — it is the SERVER-ONLY subpath entry (`dist/ssr-string.js`),
 *    which exists precisely so these bytes stay out of client bundles, and whose
 *    every helper is pure and DOM-free. It is imported for `__aihu_schild`
 *    alone, so that a resolved child component is serialized by the SAME
 *    function the compiled string renderer calls. Duplicating that logic here
 *    would let the two renderers drift in CAPABILITY, which nothing tests —
 *    the byte-level differential suite only pins them when both render the same
 *    things. `@aihu/runtime` is a devDependency, not a dependency: rolldown's
 *    narrow external list means the helper is INLINED into `dist`, so consumers
 *    install nothing extra and there is still exactly one source file. Verified
 *    after the build: no `dist` chunk imports `@aihu/runtime`, and the helper
 *    lands in the node entry beside the rest of this file — `dist/index.js`,
 *    the entry a browser/edge/Deno bundle pulls, gains nothing. Unlike
 *    `@aihu/signals` (external, because a private copy would break scope
 *    identity) the helper is pure, so a bundled copy is safe.
 *
 *    COST, stated plainly: every package whose tsconfig maps `@aihu/server` to
 *    SOURCE must also map `@aihu/runtime/ssr` to source, or it fails TS2307 on
 *    a clean tree — TypeScript replaces a base config's `paths` rather than
 *    merging them, so this cannot be inherited from `tsconfig.base.json`. That
 *    is 13 files today (the 12 package tsconfigs that map `@aihu/server`, plus
 *    the root). A new package that maps `@aihu/server` and skips this will
 *    break, and nothing derives the mapping the way `check-moon-graph.ts`
 *    derives build edges — a gap worth closing if this pattern spreads.
 * 2. Runs in: Workers, Deno, Bun, Node ESM.
 * 3. NEVER import @aihu/context at module level — use injection slots (_setContextFns).
 * 4. NEVER import @aihu/store at module level — its registry rides @aihu/context,
 *    which rule 3 already bans. Store serialization is an injection slot too
 *    (_setStoreSerializer), wired by the app's SSR entry at startup.
 *
 * State channel (wave 3): after a hydratable render, one
 * `<script type="application/json" id="__aihu_state__">` script is emitted
 * carrying `{ v: 1, stores: {...}, signals?: {...} }` — `stores` from the
 * injected store serializer, `signals` from either `SsrOptions.serializer`
 * (an arbor MountScope-style snapshot) or, by default, a post-render walk of
 * the rendered tree collecting writable-signal values at the SAME path keys
 * the hydration walker uses (`<path>.text`, `<path>.attr:<key>`), so the
 * client can pre-seed signals instead of re-deriving them.

 * makes it so (`P { base: Some(pv), … }` in `ssr_string_emit.rs`), because only
 * there is a segment a runtime value. The walker had no mirror at all, so a
 * component referenced inside a loop resolved here and stayed an empty element
 * on the compiled fast path.
 *
 * The first mirror read "every segment is digits", which was a PROXY for
 * literalness rather than the thing itself — and too strict by exactly one
 * shape. `{#if}` bodies continue at `PATH.conditional.true`, a suffix fixed at
 * compile time, so the emitter resolves there while the digits rule declined:
 * `<div if={ready}><site-header></site-header></div>` — an entirely ordinary
 * template — became a fresh divergence in the act of fixing `{#each}`.
 *
 * So test the real property. `_structuralSubtrees` above builds every non-index
 * segment, and it builds exactly two shapes: `conditional` + `true` (fixed) and
 * `list` + KEY (runtime). A path is literal iff it contains no `list` segment;
 * checking for the literal `list` is sound even against hostile keys, because
 * the key always FOLLOWS it — `each={x of ['list']} key={x}` yields
 * `…list.list`, which this rejects at the first of the two.
 *
 * Anything unrecognized is rejected: declining too much only costs a child its
 * server markup, while declining too little costs byte-identity.
 *
 * Note this can only ever be a mirror, never the same code — the emitter tests
 * a struct field it built, this tests a string. The enforcement is the
 * per-boundary differential fixture set in `ssr-string-differential.test.ts`.
