# @aihu/arbor

## 2.0.0

### Minor Changes

- [#413](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/pull/413) [`514336d`](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/commit/514336da5892c29e9e02d7a6391bb06c62d688c3) Thanks [@srmcguirt](https://github.com/srmcguirt)! - Reactivity correctness pass on @aihu/signals + hot-path refinement of @aihu/arbor.

  Signals — four correctness fixes, each with regression tests:

  - **Diamond graphs with equality suppression no longer miss updates.** The
    equality short-circuit (`shallowClear`) was last-settled-dep-wins: an
    unchanged computed dep could erase the mark contributed by a sibling dep
    that DID change (a written signal or a changed computed), silently skipping
    the effect run or leaving a sibling computed serving a stale cache. A new
    internal `CONFIRMED` flag records "an actual value change reached this sub";
    confirmed marks are immune to equality suppression.
  - **Dynamic dependency pruning.** Effects and computeds now drop dep edges
    they did not re-read on their latest run (`cond() ? a() : b()` unsubscribes
    from `a` after switching to `b`). Previously stale deps notified forever —
    extra effect runs and recomputes on every write to an abandoned branch.
  - **An effect whose first run throws is disposed before the throw
    propagates.** Previously the partially-linked effect stayed subscribed with
    no dispose handle, re-throwing from every later signal write.
  - **A computed whose recompute throws stays STALE.** The next read retries
    `fn()` instead of silently serving the previous cached value.

  Removed (nothing in the repo consumed them): the `$state`/`State` value-shape
  wrapper (use `signal()`; `@aihu/runtime`'s `$state` SFC macro is unrelated and
  unaffected) and arbor's never-thrown `ArborError` export.

  Perf: `drainBatch` no longer allocates a retired array per flush wave
  (index-chunked drain), drain loops are iterator-free, and arbor resolves the
  property-vs-attribute split once at bind time instead of re-running
  `namespaceURI` + `key in el` checks on every reactive attr update.

  **Lattice removed from the core.** `latticeSignal` / `boolLatticeSignal` /
  `maxLatticeSignal` (and the `LatticeSignal` type) are gone from `@aihu/signals`.
  Its only consumer was `@aihu-plugin/data`'s `createResource`, where both uses were
  plain signals in disguise — the bool coalescer is recreated per fetch (so its
  monotone merge was never exercised) and the max signal is a +1 counter. Both are
  migrated to plain `signal()`; equal-write suppression gives the same
  invalidate() coalescing for free. Frees the core of an unused abstraction.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- [#252](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/pull/252) [`84352bc`](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/commit/84352bcb901b7213d67727648545b41652b2092a) Thanks [@srmcguirt](https://github.com/srmcguirt)! - Hoist `@aihu/signals` to a `peerDependency` with a caret range (via `workspace:^`) on both `@aihu/arbor` and `@aihu/runtime`. Previously arbor declared `@aihu/signals` as a regular `dependencies` entry and runtime declared it as a `peerDependency` with `workspace:*`. `bun pm pack` rewrites `workspace:*` to an exact pin (`"0.1.0"`) at pack time — so the published manifests carried an exact-version requirement. When a consumer installed `@aihu/signals@0.1.1` at the top level, the package manager satisfied arbor's `0.1.0` pin by installing a second nested copy at `node_modules/@aihu/arbor/node_modules/@aihu/signals`.

  `@aihu/signals` keeps its `currentObserver` tracker in a module-scoped `let`. Two copies of the module → two trackers. arbor's effect set copy-A's tracker; user-code signal getters read copy-B's tracker (always `null`); `linkAdd` was skipped; no subscription was created; signal writes propagated to nothing. The user-visible symptom was `$if` (and any compiler-emitted `when([() => sig()], ...)`) rendering once and never re-evaluating.

  `workspace:^` rewrites to `^x.y.z` at pack time, so the published manifests now carry a range — consumers' hoisted copy satisfies it, the duplicate nested install goes away, and the single module instance keeps a single `currentObserver`.

  Adds a CI lint gate (`bun run lint:dep-pins`) that walks every published `@aihu/*` and `@aihu-plugin/*` package manifest and fails the build if any inter-package dependency is declared as an exact pin (bare semver) rather than a range. Prevents regression of this policy across the workspace.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- [`70fdad2`](https://github.com/fellwork/aihu/commit/70fdad254bedab492e3b46b131564605d4665537) Thanks [@srmcguirt](https://github.com/srmcguirt)! - fix: create SVG elements in SVG namespace

  `document.createElement('svg')` produces `HTMLUnknownElement` which never paints. All SVG tags now use `createElementNS` so they render correctly. `_setAttrOrProp` bypasses the property fast-path for SVG elements to avoid silently failing on read-only `SVGAnimated*` objects like `viewBox`.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- fix: set node.el in \_materialize so $class: and @html reactive effects run

  `_materialize` now writes the created DOM element back to `branch.el` immediately
  after `document.createElement`. Compiler-emitted `_onMount` callbacks read
  `_n.el` to register reactive class-toggle and `@html` effects — without this
  assignment they silently bailed, leaving all reactive bindings dead.
