# Aihu

> **An interactive framework that equally governs the security and experience of humans and AI.**

Every interface now has two audiences: the person using it, and that person's AI agent. Aihu treats them as **co-equal users of one interface**.

You author a `.aihu` single-file component and declare what each audience may see and do. A Rust compiler emits both experiences from that one declaration — the rendered UI the human drives, and the MCP tool surface the agent drives — wired to the same live instance under the same policy. No second API layer, no drift between what the user sees and what the agent can touch.

```bash
npx create-aihu my-app --template agent   # one component, two audiences — running in one command
```

*Equally governs* is concrete — one declaration fills all four quadrants:

| For | Experience | Security |
|---|---|---|
| **Humans** | Reactive UI on vanilla custom elements — sub-2 kB runtime, SSR, accessible primitives | Server-held auth and policy; the agent bridge is scoped and mediated, never a back door |
| **AI** | MCP tools + llms.txt emitted from the component itself; SSR renders real content agents can read | Nothing is agent-reachable unless declared `expose` — entitlement resolved server-side, non-regressable |

An agent never fabricates a throwaway interface for the turn — it steers the component already on screen. Where generative UI renders once and vanishes, an aihu component persists and holds its own state. That persistence is what lets both audiences drive the same instance over time, and it means the user always sees the thing the agent touched. Durable wins when the UI has to be trusted, styled, and reused.

Under the hood it's a complete meta-framework — routing, SSR, auth, data loading, and cloud adapters included. The runtime is sub-2 kB, the output is vanilla custom elements with zero runtime dependencies, and reactive text updates bind directly to a cached text node, so a targeted write costs the same whether its parent has three children or ten thousand ([benchmarks below](#performance)).

> **Status:** actively developed and shipping in `v1.0.x` releases — the reactive runtime, compiler, router, server, agent surface, CLI, styling engine, and UI primitives all work today. See [Project status](#project-status).

## Quickstart

```bash
# The agent showcase — a live <task-list> a human AND an AI agent drive
npx create-aihu my-app --template agent
cd my-app && bun install
bun run dev      # component on http://localhost:5108 · agent bridge on :5208

# …or a minimal app
npx create-aihu my-app

# …or run the canonical examples portfolio in parallel
git clone https://github.com/fellwork/aihu
cd aihu && bun install
bun run dev:examples
```

---

## What a component looks like

State, view, styles, and the agent interface — one `.aihu` file. This is [`live-counter`](./examples/live-counter) (7GUIs #1, ~25 LOC):

```aihu
@state {
  let count = state(0)

  const increment = action(
    { describe: 'Add 1 to the counter', expose: 'read write' },
    () => { count = count + 1 })
  const reset = action(
    { describe: 'Reset the counter to 0', expose: 'read write' },
    () => { count = 0 })
}

@template {
  <section class="counter">
    <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
    <button on:click={reset}>Reset</button>
    <button on:click={increment}>+</button>
  </section>
}

@style {
  .counter { display: grid; gap: 0.75rem; }
}
```

How to read it:

- **`state(0)`** declares a reactive field. Read it as `count`, write it with plain assignment — the DOM updates on the touched node.
- **`action({ … }, fn)`** is an ordinary method. Because it carries `expose: 'read write'`, it *also* becomes an MCP tool an agent can call on the live instance — governance at the declaration site. Nothing is agent-reachable unless you say so.
- **The template is prefix-less** — naked HTML, `{expr}` for reactive values, `on:click` for events.
- **It type-checks as plain TypeScript.** `state` / `prop` / `derived` / `action` carry identity types, so your editor and `tsc` see ordinary code; the compiler lowers them to reactive declarations underneath.
- **The output is a plain custom element** — no virtual DOM, no shipped framework runtime, light DOM by default.

---

## What you get

Everything below ships in the box — a compiler, a runtime, and an app framework, each usable on its own:

- **A tiny reactive core** — signals, computeds, and effects in under 2 kB, with direct DOM updates and no virtual DOM (`@aihu/signals` + `@aihu/arbor`).
- **A real Rust compiler** — pre-built per platform, plus a WebAssembly build for in-browser playgrounds.
- **Equal governance, declared in place** — mark state and actions `expose` and the compiler emits a matching AI tool schema (MCP) from the same declaration that renders the UI, with A2A protocol support alongside. What an agent may see and do is exactly what you exposed — enforced server-side, never inferred.
- **A complete app framework** — file-based routing, server-side rendering, loaders, cookies, and server actions (`@aihu/router` + `@aihu/server`).
- **Batteries included** — auth, data loading, context, a plugin system, and accessible UI primitives — all dependency-free.
- **Deploy anywhere** — first-party Cloudflare and Vercel adapters.
- **A real toolchain** — a CLI for scaffolding and builds (`aihu app`/`page`/`component`/`plugin`/`dev`/`build`) and a VS Code extension.

The output is **plain custom elements** — nothing locks you in at the consumer boundary, there's no global runtime and no hydration step, and every component serves both of its audiences by construction: rendered for the human, governed and callable for the agent.

---

## How it compares

Most component libraries give you a way to build *components*. Aihu gives you a way to build *apps* — routing, server-side rendering, data, and deployment are first-class, not add-ons.

**Aihu is to Lit what Next.js is to React:** a full app framework built on a small Web Components runtime. Solid is a single reactive package; Lit is templating plus a base class; Vue ships its own scheduler and virtual DOM. Aihu layers cleanly — use just the signals, just the runtime, or the whole framework — and it's the only one that governs a second audience at all: every component's AI surface is part of the file format, under the same policy as its human one.

## Features

### Reactive runtime
- Push-based signals, computeds, and effects with batched writes (`@aihu/signals`, ~1.8 kB gz)
- Direct DOM updates, no virtual DOM (`@aihu/arbor`, ~2.1 kB gz — targeted text writes land on a cached text node, never through the parent's child list)
- In `.aihu` files, reactivity is declared with `state` / `prop` / `derived` / `action` wrappers — plain-value reads, plain-assignment writes, no `.value` ceremony
- Synchronous mount with predictable teardown
- Compiled components register as standard custom elements (`@aihu/runtime`)

### Compiler & toolchain
- Rust-native compiler — reads `.aihu` files and emits standard custom-element classes
- Pre-built binaries for Linux, macOS, Windows, and ARM64 Linux (SHA256-verified), via `npm install @aihu/compiler`
- WebAssembly build for in-browser playgrounds (target: under 200 ms to compile a 50-line component)
- Scoped styles, slots, list/conditional rendering, type-checked templates, error boundaries, hot reload, islands, and full hydration

### AI-agent surface (built in, governed)
- Mark any `state()` / `action()` declaration `expose` and the compiler emits a matching MCP tool schema next to the Web Component — the agent's surface and the human's UI come from the same line of code
- A component-level `@agent` block adds descriptions and metadata for the manifest
- Exposure is a permission, not an annotation: entitlement is resolved server-side and the surface is non-regressable — what you didn't expose does not exist to the agent
- A2A protocol included (`@aihu/agent-a2a`)
- Auto-generates `llms.txt`, an MCP Server Card, and `robots.txt` for any app — no manual config (`@aihu-plugin/agent-readiness`)

### Full-stack capabilities
- File-based routing with nested routes and layouts (`@aihu/router`)
- Server-side rendering, streaming, loaders, cookies, and hydration (`@aihu/server`)
- Request-scoped context plus a reactive data/loader layer (`@aihu/context`, `@aihu-plugin/data`)
- Accessible UI primitives — guards, live regions, focus traps, links, and outlets
- Cloud adapters for Cloudflare and Vercel

### Developer experience
- `aihu` CLI for scaffolding and builds (`app` / `page` / `component` / `plugin` / `dev` / `build`)
- VS Code extension — syntax highlighting today, full language server in progress
- An example portfolio you can run in parallel with `bun run dev:examples`
- Built on Bun, Rolldown, Biome, and Vitest

### Standards & compliance
- **llms.txt** — every app is discoverable by AI tools out of the box
- **MCP** — Model Context Protocol compatible (Server Card, tool schemas, resources)
- **Agent-ready** — every component an app ships has an agent interface
- **Accessibility** — WCAG-oriented primitives (live regions, focus traps, skip links)

---

## Project status

Aihu is under active development and ships in `v1.0.x` releases. The reactive runtime, compiler, router, server, agent surface, CLI, styling engine (`@aihu/css-engine` — a Tailwind v4-style utility engine with scoped, **zero-browser-byte** output), and accessible UI primitives (`@aihu/primitives` — dialog, tooltip, button, and more) all work today. The `v1.0.0` milestone tag is held for one remaining piece:

- **Rich-text / markdown** support, shipping as a plugin.

A copy-paste UI registry built on the engine is also in progress.

Packages version independently (most are in the `0.x` range during early access), so you can adopt any piece on its own. **Aihu is dependency-free at runtime** — every browser-shipped package has an empty `dependencies` list. It's a research-driven codebase: each layer is pinned by a written spec before code lands, and performance regressions block merges.

Migrating between versions is mechanical — `npx aihu migrate --v2 <file>` moves templates to the prefix-less grammar, `npx aihu migrate --state <file>` moves `@state` to the wrapper model, and compiler errors carry a `fix:` hint that points at the exact change. See [`docs/cli.md`](./docs/cli.md) for the migration reference.

### `@aihu/arbor` — DOM update cost

*No cross-library comparison table is published here. [`bench/arbor`](./bench/arbor) runs under jsdom in dev mode against source, not the shipped build — it is a regression detector, not a basis for public performance claims. A comparative figure will come from js-framework-benchmark against shipped artifacts.*

What we can state exactly, because it is counted rather than timed: swapping two rows in a 1,000-row keyed list performs **4 DOM moves**, down from 1,994 before the reposition pass gained a longest-stable-subsequence step. That number is machine-independent and is pinned by a test ([`keyed-swap-dom-mutations.test.ts`](./tests/integration/keyed-swap-dom-mutations.test.ts)).

<!-- END_AUTOGEN: performance -->

> `update-1-of-10k-leaves` exercises arbor's `leaf()` binding, which keeps the text node it created at materialize time and assigns `textNode.nodeValue` directly (see `materialize.ts`). That write is O(1) in the parent's child count; reassigning `element.textContent` instead rebuilds the child list. The JSDOM timings in this table are directional only — they move with machine and load, and are not product claims.

> solid-js and @vue/runtime-dom ERROR in all JSDOM workloads (client-only API / `SVGElement` not defined). Browser-native comparison deferred to Round N+2 Playwright runner.

<!-- END_AUTOGEN: examples -->

Run all polished examples in parallel:

```bash
bun run dev:examples
```

## Toolchain

- **Runtime:** [Bun](https://bun.sh) ≥ 1.3.0, Node ≥ 20.18.0. Both required (`engines` enforced).
- **Bundler:** [Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs) — Rust-based, OXC ecosystem.
- **Test:** [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) + jsdom + [fast-check](https://github.com/dubzzz/fast-check) (property tests).
- **Lint/format:** [Biome](https://biomejs.dev).
- **Task runner:** [Moon](https://moonrepo.dev) — `moon run :build`, `moon run :typecheck`.
- **Size budget:** [size-limit](https://github.com/ai/size-limit) gates per-package gzipped bundles.
- **Tool versions:** pinned via [proto](https://moonrepo.dev/proto) (`.prototools`).

## Workspace dev loop

```bash
bun install
bun run build      # build all packages
bun run test       # TS + Rust suites (unit + integration + compliance)
bun run size       # per-package gzipped bundle gates
bun run check      # biome lint + format
bash scripts/check-boundary.sh   # AC-7: hard boundary (no client imports in server layer)
bash scripts/check-edge-safe.sh  # AC-6: no Node-only globals in dist bundles
bun run test:quality              # Lighthouse gate (≥ 90 on perf/a11y/best-practices/seo)
```

Run the bench suites:

```bash
cd bench/signals && bun src/runner.ts   # signals vs SOTA
cd bench/arbor   && bun src/runner.ts   # arbor vs SOTA (JSDOM)
```

Use the packages directly:

```ts
import { signal, computed, effect } from '@aihu/signals'
import { branch, leaf, mount } from '@aihu/arbor'
import { defineComponent } from '@aihu/runtime'
import { registerAgentMetadata } from '@aihu/agent'

const [count, setCount] = signal(0)
const tree = branch('div', null, [leaf([count, setCount])])
const scope = mount(tree, document.body)
setCount(1) // DOM updates synchronously via nodeValue
scope.dispose()
```

Edge / server (fetch-API, works on Cloudflare Workers, Deno, Bun) — request-router shape from `@aihu/server`. Two distinct routing APIs ship in aihu: `@aihu/server.createRequestRouter` builds a fetch-API request handler from an explicit route manifest (shown below), while `@aihu/router.createRouter` powers file-based routing via the v1 Vite plugin (`viteRouterPlugin`); see [`apps/docs/src/content/docs/guides/routing-layouts.md`](./apps/docs/src/content/docs/guides/routing-layouts.md).

```ts
import { createRequestRouter, defineRoute, json } from '@aihu/server'
import { createAgentReadinessRoutes } from '@aihu-plugin/agent-readiness'

const ar = createAgentReadinessRoutes({
  name: 'My App',
  endpoint: 'https://myapp.workers.dev/mcp',
  summary: 'A aihu-powered app.',
})

const router = createRequestRouter({
  routes: [
    defineRoute('/llms.txt', ar.llmsTxt),
    defineRoute('/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json', ar.mcpServerCard),
    defineRoute('/robots.txt', ar.robotsTxt),
    defineRoute('/api/hello', () => json({ hello: 'world' })),
  ],
})

// Cloudflare Worker
export default { fetch: router }
// Deno / Bun
// Deno.serve(router)  |  Bun.serve({ fetch: router })
```

## Compliance

The agent-protocol badges are backed by real test gates in `bun run test`.

| Gate | Tests | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `llms.txt` format (llmstxt.org spec) | 9 tests in `packages/plugin-agent-readiness/tests/compliance/llms-txt-spec.test.ts` | passing |
| MCP Server Card schema (SEP-1649) | 14 tests in `packages/plugin-agent-readiness/tests/compliance/mcp-server-card-schema.test.ts` | passing |
| `robots.txt` RFC 9309 | 7 tests in `packages/plugin-agent-readiness/tests/compliance/robots-rfc9309.test.ts` | passing |
| isitagentready.com endpoint checklist | 7 tests in `packages/plugin-agent-readiness/tests/compliance/isitagentready.test.ts` | passing |
| SSR output structural checks | 12 tests in `packages/server/tests/compliance/ssr-output.test.ts` | passing |
| Lighthouse quality gate (≥ 90 all categories) | `bun run test:quality` via `scripts/lighthouse.ts` | passing |

Run all compliance checks: `bun run test && bun run test:quality`
